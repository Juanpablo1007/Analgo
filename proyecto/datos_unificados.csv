Although the first computational thinking initiatives are being applied from the earliest school ages, this research focuses on the secondary education level. Specifically, the objective is the following: to analyse the implementation of Arduino, as well as the benefits and opportunities it brings to secondary school students. For this purpose, documentary research has been undertaken applying a systematic review according to the PRISMA 2020 framework following the PiCoS strategy. Atlas.ti 9 was used to analyse the information. Out of 316 papers identified, 37 were included in the research. In relation to the results, Arduino is primarily used in technology and physics subjects, although it is also used to develop interdisciplinary STEAM projects. As a rule, it is used to learn programming languages, but likewise as a resource to develop science experiments. LED lights, servomotors and breadboards are among the most commonly used resources together with the Arduino board. and Scratch was the most widely used software. The initiatives implemented have yielded both positive and negative results, for example, one drawback is that some projects are very difficult, and some achievements such as: increased motivation towards the contents addressed or also the development of some soft skills, such as problem solving.",,

Therefore, these two constructs have been extensively researched in recent years, but the associations between them are yet to be fully understood. This study takes another step towards bridging this gap by examining the association between CT and three types of creativity, i.e., Figural Creative Thinking, Verbal Creative Thinking, and Computational Creativity. Data was collected from 119 ninth-grade students (14–15 years old) from Israel. Students took two commonly used creativity tests (Torrance's Test of Creative Thinking, and the Alternative Uses Test). They also used Kodetu—an online learning environment for CT—and we used the system log files to measure their CT acquirement and their computational creativity. Findings suggest some nuanced associations between the four sets of variables. Specifically, we point out the limited associations between verbal and figural creativities, some of which are negative; also, we found that the associations between creative thinking and CT, as well as between creative thinking and computational creativity, differ by gender.",,

Such knowledge and skills have led to the emergence of AI literacy. Despite the importance of AI literacy in everyday life, little is known about its determinants. To better understand the determinants of AI literacy, we attempted to build a research model relying on previous research and different theoretical frameworks. The model incorporated digital divide, cognitive absorption, and computational thinking. As a major finding from the current study, computational thinking was found to be a significant determinant of AI literacy, which facilitate using, recognizing, and evaluating AI-based technologies. Moreover, we found out that individuals with physical access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) are more expected to use and recognize AI. Also, motivation and skills in using ICTs enable individuals to better evaluate the outcomes of AI-based technologies. The findings also showed that convenient access to ICTs contributes to a deep involvement with AI-based technologies in the use. Further, individuals with higher motivation and skills to use AI technologies are likely to have a pleasant experience after using these technologies.",,

This paper presents validity and reliability evidence of a performance-based assessment of CT using item response theory (IRT) from 272 children aged 4–8. Using a two-parameter logistic model IRT model (2PL IRT), we confirmed that model- and item-level fits are acceptable. Item analyses revealed a high discriminability (M = 2.26, SD = 1.12) and a moderate item difficulty (M = −0.21; SD = 0.86), on average, across 19 items. Reliability analysis demonstrated that the assessment was substantially reliable (marginal reliability: rxx = 0.87). Differential item functioning (DIF) analyses indicated that the assessment estimated children's item parameters fairly, regardless of their gender and age. However, we confirmed gaps in latent ability (θ) of CT by gender and age: boys showed higher latent ability of CT than girls, and old children (above 72 months) showed higher latent ability than young children (below 72 months). Findings suggest the assessment is a fair measure that can serve as a reliable and valid tool to assess CT for children who are emerging readers.",,

We explored how preschoolers develop understanding of spatial concepts and computational thinking as the children took turns navigating a path during guided play with a programmable robot. Our analysis of the data included a multimodal visualization of the exchanges between the teacher, children, and a programmable robotic device. The findings highlight the effects that arose from the physical-digital convergence of technology integrated into play including: (a) the robot evoked a chain of actions, enacting pedagogic forces that transformed children's learning; (b) children used their own bodies as spatial referents, co-locating themselves in space with the robot; (c) the teacher remained a key actor, providing verbal and nonverbal scaffolding to promote children's understanding and mastery of spatial and computational concepts; and (d) talking with the teacher about spatial concepts combined with the interactions with the robot enhanced children's acquisition of spatial ideas relative to the quantity of children's verbal expressions and complexity of their applied spatial skills and computational thinking.",,

This has been associated with calls for computational thinking to be considered a ‘21St Century’ competency, valuable to all students as a transferable process for solving problems and building understanding of human behaviour and systems. However, while computational thinking is a focus of most secondary school computer science curricula, proponents such as Jeanette Wing argue its relevance for younger students, indicating more work must be done investigating its development in early years' education. This study used a structured, problem-based curriculum supported by guided inquiry pedagogy, to explore 6 year old students' learning of basic computational thinking concepts and practices while coding programmable floor robots (Blue-bots and an iPad app). Results indicated improvement across the seven lessons in students' sequencing/algorithm authoring, error correction, and pattern recognition. Furthermore, they revealed evidence of higher order thinking such as identifying patterns in code, and how these can be transferred to help solve problems of different designs. While currently play-based approaches are used to introduce computational thinking concepts and practices in early years' education, results from this study suggest that more structured, problem-based methods should be seriously considered. Results challenge commonly understood developmental theories about what young children can and can't do, contextualised within the field of computer science, and hold implications for early years' teachers' professional knowledge and pedagogy if they are to promote their students' learning in this increasingly important area. Given rapid technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) and increasingly earlier exposure of young children to digitally-mediated information, this study provides support for the earlier and more systematic introduction of basic digital literacy knowledge and skills in early years' education.",,

However, research gaps remain in understanding how SRL and CT interact from a developmental perspective. Our study designed a program with tailored animations and worksheets to specifically foster students' learning and cognitive development. Using a mixed-methods approach, we administered surveys among 1235 students from 29 Hong Kong primary schools to investigate a dynamic learning system comprising SRL and CT in a large-scale CT program. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 students to further probe insights. Quantitative findings revealed a mutually reinforcing relationship in the dynamic system, suggesting that higher SRL skills enhance cognitive CT abilities, and vice versa. Complementing these results, qualitative findings showed that integrating animations and worksheets into the CT program significantly boosted students' SRL and cognitive development. These findings have significant implications for educational practices and curriculum design. Schools should consider implementing SRL strategies, such as proactive goal setting and reflective evaluation, within their curricula to promote students’ cognitive development. Furthermore, strategic investments in educational technology, including collaborations with EdTech developers, are essential to create effective, pedagogically sound tools that enhance learning outcomes. These insights provide valuable guidance for creating a supportive SRL environment that fosters cognitive development in primary school education.",,

For analysis, structural equation modeling was employed, demonstrating satisfactory construct validity and instrument reliability. Based on the results, there was a positive association between computational thinking and mathematical creative thinking. In addition, perceived creativity had a positive impact on mathematical creative thinking, whereas creative self-efficacy showed a negative association. As for the empirical model, it revealed that computational thinking plays a mediating role, connecting perceived creativity and creative self-efficacy to mathematical creative thinking.

Drawing on embodied notions of cognition, we first examine the literature that supports how children's computational thinking emerges as a possibility space that involves conceptualizing possible actions in a given moment, deciding which action to take by anticipating the results of a possible action, and learning from the actions that they have taken. We then use a grounded approach to analyze the problem-solving process of two 5th-grade children who engaged in an educational robotics activity over two 50-minute class periods. The findings lend support for approaching children's computational thinking as a cycle of action-taking that includes conceptualizing, anticipating, and taking action. The findings also support the pedagogical practice of having children predict the results of a computer program to enhance their computational thinking. Implications for the way that teachers can support children in learning to conceptualize what is possible and take action from it are discussed.",,

However, many student teachers face low expectancy of success and heightened anxiety towards computational thinking. Self-worth theory suggests that this may lead to a self-worth threat and in consequence to engagement in self-protective behaviours, hampering the successful acquisition of skills needed to implement computational thinking into their future classrooms. Aims This study aims to investigate potential self-worth threats as amplifiers of student teachers’ resistance to engage in computational thinking. Method 323 student teachers participated in the study. Participants filled out a questionnaire on expectancy of success and anxiety towards computational thinking, and rated how likely they were to engage in self-protective behaviours, i.e., self-handicapping, avoiding novelty, and academic cheating, when learning about computational thinking at the start of the semester. Results Students showed heightened levels of anxiety and low levels of expectancy towards computational thinking. Further, they reported that they would be likely to engage in self-protective behaviours. A structural equation model showed that anxiety towards computational thinking was positively related to self-protective behaviours. Moreover, expectancy had a negative indirect effect via anxiety towards computational thinking on self-protective behaviours. Discussion Student teachers might experience self-worth threats when learning about computational thinking and engage in self-protective behaviours that might hamper their success.

As a helpful pedagogical facilitator, metaphors can help turn abstract concepts into more concrete and clear concepts that learners are familiar with. Therefore, this research proposed a metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach and explored its impact on young children's CT and behavioral patterns. A total of 118 children aged 5–6 were recruited in this experiment with two conditions: the experimental group adopted the metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach while the control group used the conventional robot programming (CRP) approach.

CT is a problem-solving skill that is crucial in the 21st century. CT may be used to support language education. Courses in English as a foreign language often need an effective writing component that includes writing organization and language use, as demonstrated by the poor writing samples often generated by students of these courses. To address the problems, CT, which is a higher-order mode of problem-solving and knowledge acquisition optimization, was used. The experimental group was instructed using the CT teaching model based on CT's essential components (decomposition, generalization, abstraction, algorithm, and evaluation), whereas the control group was taught using the conventional method. In total, 58 undergraduate students divided into two groups participated in this study. A combination of writing, CT skills, surveys, and interviews were used to collect data according to an experimental design. The collected quantitative data were analyzed through analysis of covariance and structural equation modeling, and the MAXQDA 2022software was used to analyze the collected qualitative data. The results of this study indicate that incorporating CT into an English writing course enhances the writing and higher-order thinking skills of students.

Moderator analyses indicated that short-term (less than four weeks) robot-supported learning had a larger effect (g = 0.901) on CT practice than long-term (more than eleven weeks) learning (g = 0.309). This meta-analysis indicates that educators could apply robot-supported learning to cultivate students' CT and concludes with related implications.",,

Epistemic overlap between computational thinking practices and moral reasoning suggest that these contexts are potentially rich sites to see “seeds of CT” in children's reasoning and can provide rich educational pathways for children into CT. Taking a case-study approach, we examine the reasoning of a second-grader, Ollie, on a task involving fair allocation of resources to victims of a natural disaster. Our analysis finds that Ollie's reasoning was rich with seeds of CT (e.g., problem formulation, abstraction, complex-systems thinking) and that empathy served as an important supporting role to the CT. This work has implications for curricular design, suggesting that fairness and resource allocation scenarios with built-in opportunities for empathy might provide rich sandboxes for CT integration.",,

Meanwhile, computational thinking (CT) skills are fostered which influence communicative language teaching and learning. Despite CT's established importance in science education, its significance in language teaching remains scarce. This study contributes to knowledge synthesis and methodological development by reviewing 16 journal articles, analyzing CT applications in language learning across educational contexts, intervention tools, CT skills, language acquisition, and assessment methods. The results indicate that (a) more CT-involved activities are needed for primary, secondary, and tertiary education, (b) educational robots and Scratch stand out as the most trending intervention tools, (c) CT skills such as decomposition, abstraction, generalization and so on have a positive effect on students’ foreign language acquisition, especially in grammar and writing, (d) assessment of CT development can be surveyed through a validated and reliable instrument such as computer programming self-efficacy scale or an online platform: Dr. Scratch; Conversely, there is a diversity of evaluation tools in foreign language learning. This study is the first to review experimental research on integrating computational thinking into foreign language learning and offers significant implications for future research.",,
