Abstract: A novel method of AC sensing is presented that uses a double nanohole (DNH) nanoaperture atop a solid-state nanopore (ssNP) to trap analytes and measure their optical and electrical properties. In this method analytes are propelled by an external applied voltage towards the sensor until they are trapped at the DNH-ssNP interface via a self-induced back action (SIBA) plasmonic force. We have previously named this method SIBA Actuated Nanopore Electrophoresis (SANE) sensing and have shown its ability to perform concurrent optical and DC electrical measurements. Here

Abstract: Calculus as a prerequisite course to other advanced mathematics courses is one of the important and difficult courses for undergraduate students in many fields of study. Mathematical thinking is an important method to support students in the learning of calculus and specifically multivariable calculus. Researchers endeavour to support student's mathematical thinking in calculus with or without computer-based tools. The main goal of this paper is to illustrate the importance of using computer-based tools for fostering student's mathematical thinking to overcome their obstacles in multivariable calculus.

Abstract: Capacitive deionization (CDI) is a novel and prospective technique mainly for desalination
Abstract: Charles S. Peirce developed a process philosophy featuring a non-theistic agapistic evolution from nothingness. It is an Eastern inspired alternative to the Western mechanical ontology of classical science also inspired by the American transcendentalists. Advaitism and Buddhism are the two most important Eastern philosophical traditions that encompass scientific knowledge and the idea of spontaneous evolutionary development. This article attempts to show how Peirce's non-mechanistic triadic semiotic process theory is suited better to embrace the quantum field view than mechanistic and information-based views are with regard to a theory of the emergence of consciousness. Peirce views the universe as a reasoning process developing from pure potentiality to the fully ordered rational Summon Bonum. The paper compares this with John Archibald Wheeler's “It from bit” cosmogony based on quantum information science

Abstract: Children’s multiplicative thinking as the visualization of equal group structures and the enumeration the composite units was the subject of this study. The results were obtained from a small sample of Australian children (n = 18) in their first year of school (mean age 5 years 6 months) who participated in a lesson taught by their classroom teacher. The 12 Little Ducks problem stimulated children to visualize and to draw different ways of making equal groups. Fifteen children (83 %) could identify and create equal groups; eight of these children (44 %) could also quantify the number of groups they formed. These findings show that some young children understand early multiplicative ideas and can visualize equal group situations and communicate about these through their drawings and talk. The study emphasises the value of encouraging mathematical visualization from an early age; using open thought-provoking problems to reveal children’s thinking; and promoting drawing as a form of mathematical communication.

Abstract: Our conceptual model demonstrates our goal to investigate the impact of clinical decision support (CDS) utilization on cancer screening improvement strategies in the community health care (CHC) setting. We employed a dual modeling technique using both statistical and computational modeling to evaluate impact. Our statistical model used the Spearman’s Rho test to evaluate the strength of relationship between our proximal outcome measures (CDS utilization) against our distal outcome measure (provider self-reported cancer screening improvement). Our computational model relied on network evolution theory and made use of a tool called Construct-TM to model the use of CDS measured by the rate of organizational learning. We employed the use of previously collected survey data from community health centers Cancer Health Disparities Collaborative (HDCC). Our intent is to demonstrate the added valued gained by using a computational modeling tool in conjunction with a statistical analysis when evaluating the impact a health information technology

Abstract: The implementation of effective professional development courses for K-12 teachers on computational thinking (CT) in relation to programming remains a challenge. There is a lack of high-quality empirical research on teacher development in CT in relation to programming. This study addressed that situation by providing empirical evidence of the design and evaluation of such a teacher development program in primary schools. Seventy-six in-service teachers participated in a program comprising two 39-h courses. One course focused on the fundamental subject knowledge of programming for CT development together with pedagogy. The other focused on the development of advanced knowledge while providing opportunities to practice teaching in the classroom and to reflect on the practice. The results indicate that the participants developed a better understanding of CT concepts and practices and improved in three of the four content knowledge related dimensions of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) across the two courses. The three dimensions were content knowledge of programming for CT development

It then goes into the main concepts covered in the previous chapters and shows how they can be generalized into broader computational problem solving techniques.
Abstract: This chapter introduces the concept of computational thinking. It first reviews the main goals of parallel programming. It then discusses the thinking process of algorithm selection and problem decomposition. For a given problem the programmer will typically have to select from a variety of algorithms. Some of these algorithms achieve different tradeoffs while maintaining the same numerical accuracy. Others involve sacrificing some level of accuracy to achieve much more scalable running times. For the selected algorithm

Abstract: Understanding and cognition are traditionally viewed as philosophical and scientific issues where there is little room for contribution from the design community. This article proposes a radically different approach based on the observation that we live in a world that is more complex than our minds/brains possess the ability to process in its entirety. Our limited equipment forces us to deal with only selected aspects of any given piece of that complex world at each instant. Selection—be it conscious or unconscious—involves agency and choice. Design and design thinking scholars have much to say about how agency and choice can be impacted by still other choices—context

Thirty-nine individuals with MDD underwent RNT induction during fMRI. Trait-RNT was measured by the Ruminative Response Scale (RRS) and state-RNT was measured by a visual analogue scale. We employed a connectome-wide association analysis examining the association between RNT intensity with striatal and thalamic connectivity.
This is the first study to demonstrate a prospective link between experience-based decision-making and depressive symptoms. Our results suggest that enhanced risk aversion in experience-based decision-making may be an important contributor to the development of depressive symptoms.
