Abstract: One of the most important challenges of education is the formation of proper computational thinking (CT). In line with K-12 Computer Science Framework (k12cs.org) the term of CT refers to the “thought processes involved in expressing solutions as computational steps or algorithms that can be carried out by a computer”. CT is a problem solving process essential to the development of computer applications
Abstract: The paper considers the approach to solving the problem of preventing the information system vulnerability that arises due to the insertion and / or performance of a semantically incorrect script (XSS-vulnerability). The solution of this task suggests modelling the information exchange between active objects. Modelling is supposed to be carried out within the framework of the basic applicative computing system
Abstract: Digital literacy and respective education are of growing interest in our increasingly digitalized world. Recent works stress the importance of aiming beyond the acquisition of corresponding technical competences and call for fostering children’s empowerment and participation in digitalization. Computational Empowerment (CE) pursues that goal through a creative and reflexive participatory design approach. However

It delves into modern digital involvement trends related to environmental sustainability and examines the roles of AI and blockchain in ensuring transparency and accountability. The paper also touches on community-driven methods for sustainable management
Abstract: Learning theories of depression propose that negative thinking is acquired through subsequent rewarding experiences and is often resistant to change even when it becomes associated with punishment. We examined whether this persistency of negative thinking is related to current and future levels of depressive symptoms among adolescents. Persistency of negative self-referent thinking was assessed by means of a decision-making task
Abstract: School exams often measure students' higher-order-thinking-skills (HOTS) subsequent to students' lower-order-thinking-skills (LOTS). Teachers should assess students' HOT separately from students’ LOT. Three experimental studies (N = 36/41/40) investigated whether assessing LOTS-related performances can distort subsequent judgments of HOTS-related performances within school exams in different grade levels and subjects. In each study
Abstract: This paper outlines an innovative game model for learning computational thinking (CT) skills through digital game-play. We have designed a game framework where students can practice and develop their skills in CT with little or no programming knowledge. We analyze how this game supports various CT concepts and how these concepts can be mapped to programming constructs to facilitate learning introductory computer programming. Moreover
Abstract: Rostral prefrontal cortex (RPFC) has increased in size and changed in terms of its cellular organisation during primate evolution. In parallel emerged the ability to detach oneself from the immediate environment to process abstract thoughts and solve problems and to understand other individuals’ thoughts and intentions. Rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) is thought to play an important role in supporting the integration of abstract
Abstract: This paper explores the problem-solving behavior of people in design activities through a protocol analysis of verbal reports on the interior work design process simulated by an interactive evolutionary computation (IEC). The protocol analysis method was used to explore the ways of thinking of the participants throughout the process. The analysis reveals that different parts of the interior scene have different effects on the evaluations
Abstract: That introspection may impair certain judgments and result in fabrication has been attributed to a distracting shift from more adaptive intuitive processing to more analytic and conscious processing. This phenomenon was studied in an experiment where participants made multidimensional visual choices. It was found that the effect of this shift on decision-making performance was dependent on the quality of the explanations during introspection
Abstract: This paper describes a study designed to investigate the promise of resources that support the development of computational thinking (CT) in preschool children. This study was the culmination of a collaborative research process between researchers and media developers of a home-based intervention that included media and hands-on activities created to support the development of young children's CT. The mixed-methods study included 108 families
Abstract: Thinking about what might have been—counterfactual thinking—is a common feature of the mental landscape. Key questions about counterfactual thinking center on why and how they occur and what downstream cognitive and behavioral outcomes they engender. The functional theory of counterfactual thinking aims to answer these and other questions by drawing connections to goal cognition and by specifying distinct functions that counterfactuals may serve
Abstract: This systematic review examined how computer science (CS) education was implemented in schools and its efficacy for developing students’ computational thinking (CT). Sixty-six papers were selected for this systematic review and analyzed for patterns in relation to the implementation of CS education in K-12 schools and its impact on the development of students’ CT skills. Although educational interventions have not always been successful in CS education

Abstract: Many studies try to explain thought processes based on verbal data alone and often take the linguistic variation between languages as evidence for cross-linguistic thought processes during speaking. We argue that looking at co-speech gestures might broaden the scope and shed new light on different thinking-for-speaking patterns. Data comes from a corpus study investigating the relationship between speech and gesture in two typologically different languages: Danish

Abstract: This paper intends to join the long-standing debate regarding thinking styles and personality traits—should thinking styles be measured in addition to the measurement of personality traits? The means to achieve this goal was to provide empirical evidence as well as to review other studies in the literature. The Thinking Styles Inventory and the NEO Five-Factor Inventory were administered to 267 (67 male and 200 female) students from a large research university in Beijing
Abstract: Bringing precision to the understanding and treatment of mental disorders requires instruments for studying clinically relevant individual differences. One promising approach is the development of computational assays: integrating computational models with cognitive tasks to infer latent patient-specific disease processes in brain computations. While recent years have seen many methodological advancements in computational modelling and many cross-sectional patient studies
Abstract: This meta-analysis examines whether greater computational thinking is linked to greater academic achievement among students from 1st graders in primary school to 4th year seniors at university. Results from 34 studies showed that computational thinking and academic achievement were positively correlated (0.288). Moderator analysis showed that this correlation was (a) stronger among students in Eastern cultures than Western cultures; (b) strongest among primary school students
Abstract: This study compares the effects of coding education with educational robot and unplugged coding activities on pre-school students' computational thinking and executive function skills. This study used a pre-test and post-test comparison group quasi-experimental design. The study was conducted in a public kindergarten with 48 pre-school students (24 educational robot- BeeBot® group and 24-unplugged coding group) aged 5-6. The TechCheck-K test was used to measure computational thinking skills
Abstract: This paper reports on an aspect of the EC funded Argunaut project which researched and developed awareness tools for moderators of online dialogues. In this study we report on an investigation into the nature of creative thinking in online dialogues and whether or not this creative thinking can be coded for and recognized automatically such that moderators can be alerted when creative thinking is occurring or when it has not occurred after a period of time. We outline a dialogic theory of creativity
Abstract: This longitudinal study examined changes in Computational Thinking (CT) skills in first and second grade students exposed to a developmentally appropriate coding curriculum. The “Coding as Another Language” (CAL) curriculum spans seven weeks and uses the KIBO robot to engage students in learning that integrates programming and literacy concepts. We compared children receiving CAL (N = 667) to a control group (N = 181) who participated in typical classroom activities without coding (No-CAL). TechCheck
Abstract: The history of the emerging area of tools for managing research resources and the data produced from them is summarised from the perspective of two decades of use in teaching and research at one institution. These tools are a portal or electronic laboratory notebook for computational chemistry interfaced in one direction to a high-performance computing resource and in the other direction to a modern research data repository. The essential features of both these tools are described over two generations of each
Abstract: Learning coding during early childhood is an effective way for children to practice computational thinking. Aspects of children's motivation can increase the likelihood that children approach computational thinking activities with enthusiasm and deep engagement. Gender inequities may interfere with children's readiness to take advantage of opportunities to build computational thinking skills through activities such as coding. Societal stereotypes can reduce young girls’ motivation to engage with computer science
Abstract: Computational Thinking (CT) has been investigated from different perspectives. This research aims to investigate how secondary school girls perceive CT practices – the problem-solving practices that students apply while they are engaged in programming – when using the micro:bit device in a collaborative setting. This study also explores the collaborative programming process of secondary school girls with the micro:bit device. We conducted mixed-methods research with 203 secondary school girls (in the state of Victoria
Abstract: Current automated driving technology cannot cope in numerous conditions that are basic daily driving situations for human drivers. Previous studies show that profound understanding of human drivers’ capability to interpret and anticipate traffic situations is required in order to provide similar capacities for automated driving technologies. There is currently not enough a priori understanding of these anticipatory capacities for safe driving applicable to any given driving situation. To enable the development of safer
Abstract: This chapter introduces the concept of computational thinking. It first reviews the main goals of parallel programming. It then discusses the thinking process of algorithm selection and problem decomposition. For a given problem the programmer will typically have to select from a variety of algorithms. Some of these algorithms achieve different tradeoffs while maintaining the same numerical accuracy. Others involve sacrificing some level of accuracy to achieve much more scalable running times. For the selected algorithm
Abstract: The sustainable and digital future of work may imply a dramatic equilibrium change between social factors and technological ones. We argue that providing suitable tools to support End-User Development (EUD) in the workplace could represent a way to cope with such future changes. The contributions of this paper include the analysis and characterization of the most used EUD techniques and their crossover with a new conveyed model of Computational Thinking. The synthesis between these aspects is made explicit in the construct of EUDability
Abstract: Molecular biology is a scientific discipline which has changed fundamentally in character over the past decade to rely on large scale datasets – public and locally generated - and their computational analysis and annotation. Undergraduate education of biologists must increasingly couple this domain context with a data-driven computational scientific method. Yet modern programming and scripting languages and rich computational environments such as R and MATLAB present significant barriers to those with limited exposure to computer science
Abstract: The policy for a low emission society requires that companies measure their impact from a life cycle perspective for both products and corporate reporting. This work presents new climate performance indicators to evaluate business models (BM) based on life cycle assessment (LCA) and benchmarked with statistics for Sustainable Development Goal indicator 9.4.1. The research was conducted by action case studies involving 20 small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) from various sectors. The SMEs did not have previous experience with LCA. Therefore
Abstract: A novel method of AC sensing is presented that uses a double nanohole (DNH) nanoaperture atop a solid-state nanopore (ssNP) to trap analytes and measure their optical and electrical properties. In this method analytes are propelled by an external applied voltage towards the sensor until they are trapped at the DNH-ssNP interface via a self-induced back action (SIBA) plasmonic force. We have previously named this method SIBA Actuated Nanopore Electrophoresis (SANE) sensing and have shown its ability to perform concurrent optical and DC electrical measurements. Here
Abstract: Teachers who use student thinking to make instructional decisions tend to create more positive learning experiences for students and support conceptual understanding. Looking at student work is one way college instructors learn about student thinking. We interviewed eight calculus instructors to investigate what they noticed when examining student work. Reflexive thematic analysis allowed us to classify instructors by the stance they adopted when looking at student work. Instructors who adopted an evaluative stance responded by providing examples or explaining how to solve the problem
Abstract: Three parametric design systems were tested by the authors to assess their suitability for undergraduate teaching. We used criteria taken from the ‘cognitive dimensions’ literature and an exercise of typical geometric operations in ascending order of complexity. For each system the cognitive barriers associated with the sequence of operations were plotted to create a ‘learning curve’. Different parametric systems presented distinctly different learning curves. The test exercise had to be completed in its entirety to assess the potential challenges which students with different educational levels
Abstract: Calculus as a prerequisite course to other advanced mathematics courses is one of the important and difficult courses for undergraduate students in many fields of study. Mathematical thinking is an important method to support students in the learning of calculus and specifically multivariable calculus. Researchers endeavour to support student's mathematical thinking in calculus with or without computer-based tools. The main goal of this paper is to illustrate the importance of using computer-based tools for fostering student's mathematical thinking to overcome their obstacles in multivariable calculus.
Abstract: Students with learning disabilities display a diverse array of factors that interplay with their mathematical understanding. Our aim in this paper is to discuss the extent to which one case study elementary school child with identified learning disabilities (LDs) made sense of composite units and unit fractions. We present analysis and results from multiple sessions conducted during a teaching experiment cast as one-on-one intervention. Results of a multi-phase qualitative analysis reveal two themes evident in the child’s thinking structures across the sessions: (a) Gina’s accommodations over time versus traditional progressions
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative methodology for parametric design called Design Procedures (DP) and shows how it is applied to the columns of the Expiatory Temple of the Sagrada Familia. Design Procedures are actions that generate parametric models where geometrical components are consider as variables. A brief introduction on parametric design is followed by illustrated explanations of the traditional forms of parametric models. Design Procedures is presented as an alternative to overcome the topological and geometrical limitations of traditional parametric models. The DP is able to generate all original designs by Gaudi plus an infinite number of new designs.
Abstract: Understanding and cognition are traditionally viewed as philosophical and scientific issues where there is little room for contribution from the design community. This article proposes a radically different approach based on the observation that we live in a world that is more complex than our minds/brains possess the ability to process in its entirety. Our limited equipment forces us to deal with only selected aspects of any given piece of that complex world at each instant. Selection—be it conscious or unconscious—involves agency and choice. Design and design thinking scholars have much to say about how agency and choice can be impacted by still other choices—context
Abstract: Brain connectivity is traditionally thought to be important for creativity. Here we investigated the associations of creativity measured by divergent thinking (CMDT) with resting-state functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) measures and their sex differences. We examined these relationships in the brains of 1277 healthy young adults. Whole-brain analyses revealed a significant interaction between verbal CMDT and sex on (a) regional homogeneity within an area from the left anterior temporal lobe (b) on the resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the mPFC and the left inferior frontal gyrus and (c) on fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) in several distinct areas
Abstract: Our research aims to provide information on whether students who have finished a school have mastered the ability of algorithmic thinking or the focus in their training was more on simply memorizing and using the algorithms. The question is how typical it is for each specialization in our educational system that the composition of the subjects specified in the national curricula should influence the development of problem-solving skills and limit the field of human subjects where it is less important to apply cognitive models or algorithmic thinking acquired through the study of formal sciences. The participants in the experiment were taken from the first year students of Sapientia University
Abstract: Kindergarten Social Assistive Robot (KindSAR) is an innovative tool promotes children’s development through social interaction. This pilot study demonstrates how KindSAR can assist educational staff in the teaching of geometric thinking and in promoting the metacognitive development by engaging children in interactive play activities. Children’s reactions and performances were video recorded for analysis. Most children exhibited positive interaction with the robot and a high level of enjoyment. Our results showed that their performances on geometric thinking and metacognitive tasks were improved while they “played” with the robot. To measure children’s learning we have developed a novel measure of cognitive learning
Abstract: The proliferation of digital technologies sometimes referred to as the 'industrial or technological (digital) revolution’ primarily affects the education sphere. The introduction of online learning technologies and the focus on independent and critical thinking actualizes the problem of developing these skills in future teachers and lawyers with the help of digital tools. The study looked at the critical thinking development in education while focusing on the use of digital tools in rational thinking formation in education. The research involved a random sample of undergraduate pedagogy students from [BLINDED] Institute of [BLINDED] University and graduate law students from [BLINDED] Institute. The digital tools were used to develop test tasks and logic problems
Abstract: Charles S. Peirce developed a process philosophy featuring a non-theistic agapistic evolution from nothingness. It is an Eastern inspired alternative to the Western mechanical ontology of classical science also inspired by the American transcendentalists. Advaitism and Buddhism are the two most important Eastern philosophical traditions that encompass scientific knowledge and the idea of spontaneous evolutionary development. This article attempts to show how Peirce's non-mechanistic triadic semiotic process theory is suited better to embrace the quantum field view than mechanistic and information-based views are with regard to a theory of the emergence of consciousness. Peirce views the universe as a reasoning process developing from pure potentiality to the fully ordered rational Summon Bonum. The paper compares this with John Archibald Wheeler's “It from bit” cosmogony based on quantum information science
Abstract: Children’s multiplicative thinking as the visualization of equal group structures and the enumeration the composite units was the subject of this study. The results were obtained from a small sample of Australian children (n = 18) in their first year of school (mean age 5 years 6 months) who participated in a lesson taught by their classroom teacher. The 12 Little Ducks problem stimulated children to visualize and to draw different ways of making equal groups. Fifteen children (83 %) could identify and create equal groups; eight of these children (44 %) could also quantify the number of groups they formed. These findings show that some young children understand early multiplicative ideas and can visualize equal group situations and communicate about these through their drawings and talk. The study emphasises the value of encouraging mathematical visualization from an early age; using open thought-provoking problems to reveal children’s thinking; and promoting drawing as a form of mathematical communication.
Abstract: Our conceptual model demonstrates our goal to investigate the impact of clinical decision support (CDS) utilization on cancer screening improvement strategies in the community health care (CHC) setting. We employed a dual modeling technique using both statistical and computational modeling to evaluate impact. Our statistical model used the Spearman’s Rho test to evaluate the strength of relationship between our proximal outcome measures (CDS utilization) against our distal outcome measure (provider self-reported cancer screening improvement). Our computational model relied on network evolution theory and made use of a tool called Construct-TM to model the use of CDS measured by the rate of organizational learning. We employed the use of previously collected survey data from community health centers Cancer Health Disparities Collaborative (HDCC). Our intent is to demonstrate the added valued gained by using a computational modeling tool in conjunction with a statistical analysis when evaluating the impact a health information technology
Abstract: The implementation of effective professional development courses for K-12 teachers on computational thinking (CT) in relation to programming remains a challenge. There is a lack of high-quality empirical research on teacher development in CT in relation to programming. This study addressed that situation by providing empirical evidence of the design and evaluation of such a teacher development program in primary schools. Seventy-six in-service teachers participated in a program comprising two 39-h courses. One course focused on the fundamental subject knowledge of programming for CT development together with pedagogy. The other focused on the development of advanced knowledge while providing opportunities to practice teaching in the classroom and to reflect on the practice. The results indicate that the participants developed a better understanding of CT concepts and practices and improved in three of the four content knowledge related dimensions of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) across the two courses. The three dimensions were content knowledge of programming for CT development
