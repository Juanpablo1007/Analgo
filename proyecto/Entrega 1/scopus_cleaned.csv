Both cryptocurrency markets and conventional equity markets have been influenced by these changes. This study aims to investigate the potential hedging and safe haven benefits of Bitcoin and Ethereum against risks in Asian emerging stock markets under various Covid-19 pandemic contexts including the onset of the pandemic, varying levels of panic, the extent of media attention, and sentiment analysis. Utilizing the dynamic correlation coefficients derived from the DCC-GARCH methodology, our analysis indicates that, both Bitcoin and Ethereum do not effectively serve as hedges or safe havens for major Asian emerging stock markets during the Covid-19 outbreak. These results remain robust during more extreme periods characterized by high panic, intense media attention, and negative sentiment. Nevertheless, an noteworthy exception is the case where Ethereum exhibits strong hedging properties specifically in the context of the Pakistan equity market. Recognizing these unique hedge and safe haven potential of cryptocurrencies can contribute to enhancing the effectiveness of investment strategies and risk management practices during periods of market turbulence. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Covid-19; Cryptocurrency; Fintech; Hedge; Safe haven; Stock,"Ahmed W.M.A., Stock market reactions to upside and downside volatility of Bitcoin: A quantile analysis, North Am.

The computer can aid in diagnosis via computed tomography images like PCR. Deep learning and machine learning are popular methods, and their main contributions are COVID-19 detection and prediction. This work aimed to develop an AI-based early detection strategy for COVID-19 based on computed tomography images. The model was trained and tested using a dataset that includes CT images. The SARS-COV-2 dataset contains 2482 CT images of 210 patients from publicly available sources. The modified model demonstrated encouraging outcomes by greatly enhancing the sensitivity measure (95.82±1.75), which is an essential criterion for accurately detecting instances of COVID-19 infection. In addition, the model generated higher values for the accuracy metric (91.67±1.68), the specificity (88.08±3.72), the precision metric (87.51±3.27), the F1_score (91.43±1.55), and the area under the curve (91.98±1.55). Deep learning techniques significantly facilitate the early detection of COVID-19. Its use has the potential to improve clinical doctors' readiness and the management of pandemics. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

Nanomaterial-coated paper-based electrochemical biosensors were utilized to diagnose various disease biomarkers. Nanomaterials have contributed significantly to electrochemical biosensors advancements because they improve biosensing properties such as specificity, sensitivity, robustness, and reproducibility. Moreover, the viability of environmentally friendly paper-based electrochemical biosensors for the highly sensitive detection of target analytes in complicated samples has improved. Paper-based electrode (PE) substrates are desirable for lab-scale and large-scale manufacturing applications because they are inexpensive, do not require microfluidic pumps because electrolyte migration can be achieved through capillary action, can be stacked with reagents for reagent-less applications, and can achieve multiphase detection via origami-based approaches. Therefore, this review considers the properties of functional nanomaterials, such as the active surface area available for interactions, attachment of biorecognition species to the electrode via microporous capillary action, cellulose conductivity, and photochemical functional properties, and electrochemical properties of carbon-based conductive pastes that are widely used to print sensors onto paper substrates. The conclusions can be used to improve PE biosensors for biomedical research. Recent paper-based electrodes modified with different nanomaterials for detecting various biomarkers are discussed. © 2024",Biomarker; Conductive paste; Nanomaterial; Paper-based electrode; Photoelectrochemical; Point-of-care device,"Manikandan R., Rajarathinam T., Jayaraman S., Jang H.-G., Yoon J.-H., Lee J., Paik H.-J., Chang S.-C., Coord.

The most described entity is anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, although rare cases of posterior ischemic optic neuropathy have been reported, mostly in the setting of severe disease. We present the first report of posterior ischemic optic neuropathy involving both eyes and following uncomplicated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Relevant literature is analyzed and discussed. Case Description: A 65-year-old man presented with severe painless visual loss beginning in the lower hemifield of the right eye and involving both eyes in the span of 24 hours. Visual acuity in the right eye was reduced to no light perception and to uncertain light perception in the left eye. He had recently recovered from COVID-19 which had manifested with mild respiratory symptoms that did not require medical treatment. Complete ophthalmological evaluation revealed no anomalies except for non-reactive pupils. As radiological investigations including contrast magnetic resonance and computer tomography did not reveal acute events bilateral posterior ischemic optic neuropathy was hypothesized. As giant cell arteritis is an important cause of sequential ischemic neuropathy, high dose steroid treatment was carried out until temporal biopsy ruled out vasculitis. Steroid treatment was then slowly tapered over the course of 45 days. The patient had a history of carotid stroke and thrombophilia and blood pressure monitoring after the event revealed hypotensive episodes which led to the suspension of antihypertensive medication. At one-month follow-up, a slight improvement in visual functioning was observed, with the patient being able to count fingers with both eyes. This improvement was confirmed at two months. Fundus examination revealed pale optic discs, which confirmed the diagnosis of posterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Conclusions: COVID-19 can induce vascular occlusion through endothelial dysfunction. Additionally, we propose that lowering of systemic blood pressure, as reported following infection, might also contribute to or even instigate optic nerve ischemia. © AME Medical Journal.",case report; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); ischemic optic neuropathy (ION); posterior ischemic optic neuropathy (PION),"Hayreh SS., Ischemic optic neuropathy, Prog Retin Eye Res, 28, pp. 34-62, (2009); Rho J, Dryden SC, McGuffey CD, Et al., A Case of NonArteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy with COVID-19, Cureus, 12, (2020); Yuksel B, Bicak F, Gumus F, Et al., Non-Arteritic Anterior Ischaemic Optic Neuropathy with Progressive Macular Ganglion Cell Atrophy due to COVID-19, Neuroophthalmology, 46, pp. 104-108, (2022); Moschetta L, Fasolino G, Kuijpers RW., Non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy sequential to SARSCoV-2 virus pneumonia: preventable by endothelial protection?, BMJ Case Rep, 14, (2021); Golabchi K, Rezaee A, Aghadoost D, Et al., Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy as a rare manifestation of COVID-19: a case report, Future Virol, (2021); Babazadeh A, Barary M, Ebrahimpour S, Et al., Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy as an atypical feature of COVID-19: A case report, J Fr Ophtalmol, 45, pp. e171-e173, (2022); Sanoria A, Jain P, Arora R, Et al., Bilateral sequential nonarteritic optic neuropathy post-COVID-19, Indian J Ophthalmol, 70, pp. 676-679, (2022); Romozzi M, Amorelli G, Savastano MC, Et al., COVID-19 presenting as a non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, Eur J Ophthalmol, 33, pp. NP133-NP136, (2023); Sitaula S, Poudel A, Gajurel BP., Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy in COVID-19 infection-A case report, Am J Ophthalmol Case Rep, 27, (2022); Shahri SHG, Abrishami M, Shayanfar H, Et al., Bilateral anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and choroidal ischemia in a patient with COVID-19 infection, Clin Case Rep, 11, (2023); Selvaraj V, Sacchetti D, Finn A, Et al., Acute Vision Loss in a Patient with COVID-19, R I Med J (2013), 2020, 103, pp. 37-38; Kaushik KS, Acharya UV, Krupa L., Dual hit-Magnetic resonance imaging in concomitant anterior and posterior ischemic optic neuropathy in a case of rhino-orbital mucormycosis and COVID-19, Indian J Ophthalmol, 70, pp. 300-301, (2022); Chen AH, Pakravan M, Charoenkijkajorn C, Et al., Posterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Following Recurrent COVID-19 in Prior Bilateral Sequential Nonarteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy, J Neuroophthalmol, 44, pp. e70-e72, (2024); Miller NR, Subramanian PS, Patel VR., Walsh & Hoyt’s Clinical Neuro-Ophthalmology: The Essentials, (2020); Kuhli-Hattenbach C, Scharrer I, Luchtenberg M, Et al., Selective thrombophilia screening of patients with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol, 247, pp. 485-490, (2009); Lee MH, Perl DP, Steiner J, Et al., Neurovascular injury with complement activation and inflammation in COVID-19, Brain, 145, pp. 2555-2568, (2022); Savastano A, Crincoli E, Savastano MC, Et al., Peripapillary Retinal Vascular Involvement in Early Post-COVID-19 Patients, J Clin Med, 9, (2020); Hayreh SS., Ischemic optic neuropathies-where are we now?, Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol, 251, pp. 1873-1884, (2013); Briquez PS, Rouhani SJ, Yu J, Et al., Severe COVID-19 induces autoantibodies against angiotensin II that correlate with blood pressure dysregulation and disease severity, Sci Adv, 8, (2022); Lanzani C, Simonini M, Arcidiacono T, Et al., Role of blood pressure dysregulation on kidney and mortality outcomes in COVID-19.

In the present work, a case-study was conducted by comparing human hemoglobin (Hb) oligomerization upon autohemotherapy before and after COVID-19 infection. Structural changes of Hb exposed to different concentrations of ozone (40, 60, and 80 μg/ml) in whole blood, before COVID-19 infection, was compared to Hb exposed to the highest concentration of ozone (80 μg/ml) in whole blood, in the presence of two antioxidants, cinnamaldehyde (Cin) and phenyl ethyl alcohol (PEA), after COVID-19 infection. The structural analyses in this study was performed using various techniques, including DPPH radical scavenging assay, intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, UV–VIS absorption spectroscopy, SDS-PAGE, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and molecular docking studies. The results showed that Hb oligomerization by ozone increased significantly after COVID-19 infection. In addition, at an ozone concentration of 80 μg/ml, the affinity of heme groups for globin chains and to oxygen molecules were shown to increase, whereas the stability of Hb decreased. In contrary, the addition of Cin and PEA prevented the adverse effects of ozone with PEA showing more efficacy in maintaining the native structure of Hb. Taken together, these results provided insights into the adverse effects of COVID-19 infection on Hb oligomerization and highlighted the importance of an individual's antioxidant capacity in protecting Hb from ozone, especially high ozone concentrations in autohemotherapy, and further emphasised the importance of personalising the concentration of ozone for patient administration, in order to provide a safe and effective autohemotherapy treatment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Antioxidants; Autohemotherapy; Cinnamaldehye; COVID-19; Ozone, Human hemoglobin; Phenyl ethyl alcohol","Firuzi O., Et al., Antioxidant therapy: current status and future prospects, Curr.

The goal of this study is to investigate the role of memory cells and antibodies in the immune responses against IAV and SARS-CoV-2 re-infections. To this end, we adapt a previously-published within-host mathematical model (Sadria & Layton, 2021) for the primary immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infections, by including two types of memory immune cells, i.e., memory CD8+ T-cells and memory B-cells, and by parametrising the new model with values specific to the two viruses. We first investigate the long-term dynamics of the model by identifying the virus-free steady states and studying the conditions that ensure the stability of these states. Then, we investigate the transient dynamics of this in-host model by simulating different viral reinfection times: 20 days, 60 days and 400 days after the first encounter with the pathogen. This allows us to highlight which memory immune components have the greatest impact on the viral elimination depending on the time of reinfection. Our results suggest that memory immune responses have a greater impact in the case of IAV infections compared to SARS-CoV-2 infections. Moreover, we observe that the immune response after a secondary infection is more efficient when the reinfection occurs at a shorter time. © 2024 The Authors",Covid-19; Immunology; Influenza a; Memory cells;

This study evaluates the MAGLUMI® SARS-CoV-2 Ag N protein chemiluminescent immunoassay (MAG-CLIA) for its analytical performance and its role in predicting disease severity and prognosis among severe COVID-19 patients with comorbidities. Methods: Analytical validation of plasma MAG-CLIA SARS-CoV-2 Ag N protein encompassed precision, interference, LoQ and linearity. Plasma N protein concentrations and other biomarkers were measured within 48 h of admission, tracked until discharge or death. The Mann-Whitney U test explored the association between plasma N protein and COVID-19 severity or prognosis. Longitudinal monitoring of plasma N protein dynamics was conducted in representative patients. Results: MAG-CLIA demonstrated precise quantification of plasma N protein with a CV below 10 % and minimal interference. The LoQ was 0.88 ng/L, with a broad linear range. Plasma N protein showed high diagnostic accuracy for COVID-19, achieving 95.42 % specificity and 78.32 % sensitivity at 2.388 ng/L. Plasma N protein emerged as a valuable prognostic indicator, correlating with mechanical ventilation need and patient survival. Plasma N protein concentrations ≥ 424.3 ng/L (AUC 0.8102, sensitivity 78.38 %, specificity 85.48 %) were associated with poor prognosis in severe COVID-19 patients with comorbidities. Conclusions: MAG-CLIA's SARS-CoV-2 N protein detection in plasma demonstrates both analytical reliability and clinical relevance in our inaugural evaluation.

Despite effective at early stage, long-term treatment with glucocorticoids can lead to a variety of adverse effects and limited benefits. The Chinese traditional herb Pogostemonis Herba is the aerial part of Pogostemon Cablin (Blanco) Benth., which has potent antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. It was used widely for treating various throat and respiratory diseases, including COVID-19, viral infection, cough, allergic asthma, acute lung injury and lung cancer. Aim of the study: To investigate the antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects of chemical compounds from Pogostemonis Herba in SARS-CoV-2-infected hACE2-overexpressing mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells and hACE2 transgenic mice. Materials and methods: The hACE2-overexpressing RAW264.7 cells were exposed with SARS-CoV-2. The cell viability was detected by CCK8 assay and cell apoptotic rate was by flow cytometric assay. The expressions of macrophage M1 phenotype markers (TNF-α and IL-6) and M2 markers (IL-10 and Arg-1) as well as the viral loads were detected by qPCR. The mice were inoculated intranasally with SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant to induce viral pneumonia. The levels of macrophages, neutrophils, and T cells in the lung tissues of infected mice were analyzed by full spectrum flow cytometry. The expressions of key proteins were detected by Western blot assay. Results: Diosmetin-7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (DG) presented the strongest anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Intervention with DG at the concentrations of 0.625–2.5 μM not only reduced the viral replication, cell apoptosis, and the productions of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) in SARS-CoV-2-infected RAW264.7 cells, but also reversed macrophage polarity from M1 to M2 phenotype. Furthermore, treatment with DG (25–100 mg/kg) alleviated acute lung injury, and reduced macrophage infiltration in SARS-COV-2-infected mice. Mechanistically, DG inhibited SARS-COV-2 gene expression and HK3 translation via targeting YTHDF1, resulting in the inactivation of glycolysis-mediated NF-κB pathway. Conclusions: DG exerted the potent antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities. It reduced pneumonia in SARS-COV-2-infected mice via inhibiting the viral replication and accelerating M2 macrophage polarization via targeting YTHDF1, indicating its potential for COVID-19 treatment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Apigenin (pubchem CID: 5280443); Apigenin-7-glucoside (pubchem CID: 5280704); Diosmetin-7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (pubchem CID: 11016019); Glycolysis; HK3; Luteolin (pubchem CID: 5280445); Luteolin-7-glucoside (pubchem CID: 5280637); Macrophage polarization; Ombuin (pubchem CID: 5320287); Quercetin (pubchem CID: 5280343); Remdesivir (pubchem CID: 121304016); Tilianin (pubchem CID: 5321954); Velutin (pubchem CID: 5464381); Viral replication; Vitexin (pubchem CID: 5280441); YTHDF1,"Abdalla Y., Abdalla A., Hamza A.A., Amin A., Safranal prevents liver cancer through inhibiting oxidative stress and alleviating inflammation, Front.

In the crystalline state, molecules of 1 exhibited C–H···O intramolecular bonds and produced a 1D chain through N–H···N and C–H···N contacts. Chains produce a supramolecular 2D layer due to π···π interactions. In the UV–vis spectrum, 1 exhibits bands up to ∼360 nm and is emissive with a broad band from about 335 to 450 nm, with the maximum at 365 nm. Fine features of 1 were revealed using the density functional theory (DFT) calculations in water. The computed geometrical parameters are in accordance with the experimental values. The frontier electronic orbitals were found on the molecule except for the propyl fragment, and 1 was determined as a strong electrophile. The computed absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination and toxicity (ADMET) features predicted positive gastrointestinal absorption (GA) activity and negative human blood-brain barrier (BBB) property of 1. Compound 1 in silico tested to inhibit some of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins. Papain-like protease (PLpro) and Nonstructural protein 3 (Nsp3_range 207–379-MES) were established to interact with 1 more efficiently. The PLpro complex with 1 exhibits a ligand efficiency scores for a Hit. The present study also delved into elucidating the cytotoxic potential of compound 1 in Dalton's Lymphoma (DL) malignant cancer cell lines, aiming to explore its anticancer efficacy. Furthermore, this investigation extends its purview to scrutinize the cytotoxicity profile of the aforementioned compound on normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), thus enabling a comprehensive comparative analysis of cellular responses under both neoplastic and non-neoplastic cell lines. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Anticancer agent; COVID-19; Naphthyridine; Tetrazole; Theoretical computations; X-ray analysis,"Koller G., Über das 1.8-naphthyridin, Berichte, 60, pp. 1918-1920, (1927); Ikekawa N., Studies on naphthyridines.

We investigated interoceptive mechanisms in COVID-19 survivors focusing on their potential link with psychopathology and inflammatory biomarkers. Methods: We assessed interoceptive accuracy (IAc) and time-perceiving (TA) skills of 57 COVID-19 survivors one month after hospital discharge through, respectively, a heartbeats perception task and a time duration task. Each participant was assessed about his interoceptive awareness (IAw) through Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness questionnaire (MAIA) and then, screened for post-traumatic (Impact of Events Scale – IES-R), anxious (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory – STAI-Y1) and depressive (Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale - ZSDS; Beck Depression Inventory - BDI-13) symptoms. Biomarkers of inflammation (platelet count, PC; mean platelet volume, MPV and systemic immune-inflammation index, SII) were obtained in a subsample of 40 survivors by a blood sampling conducted at admission and discharge time from the hospital. Correlational, GLM, GLMZ, and mediation analyses were performed. Results: IAc did not correlate with TA confirming the reliability of interoceptive measure. IAc positively predicts MAIA's Trusting subscale and negatively predicts anxious psychopathology which fully mediates the effect of IAc on Trusting.PC at hospital admission predicts anxiety at one month after recovery. Again, a higher decrease of SII during hospitalization predicts higher IAc skill and lower anxiety state at one month. The link between SII change and anxiety is fully mediated by IAc. Conclusions: Our results unveil a potential key role of interoception and brain-body interchange in the exacerbation and maintenance of anxiety psychopathology in COVID-19 survivors. © 2024",Anxiety; COVID-19; Inflammatory biomarkers; Interoceptive accuracy; Interoceptive awareness,"Datta S.D., Talwar A., Lee J.T., A proposed framework and timeline ofthe spectrum of disease due to SARS-CoV-2.

Using a time-varying quantile-based framework and daily data from June 5, 2014 to December 10, 2023, the safe-haven role of credit VIX is confirmed irrespective of bond sector. The safe-haven property of credit VIX is pronounced for high-yield bonds which embed a high credit risk-premium. This result stands when taking into account interest rate volatility, as measured by the MOVE index. A time-varying analysis shows the persistence of credit VIX as a safe-haven for all bond sectors after the COVID-19 pandemic and during a high US interest-rate regime. Corporate bond investors and traders can use these findings to refine their investment and trading decisions and offset credit risk during both normal and turbulent periods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",CBOE credit VIX; COVID-19 outbreak; Cross-quantilograms and quantiles; Fed tightening cycle; High-yield sector bonds; Investment-grade sector bonds; Safe-haven,"Adra S., Menassa E., Uncertainty and corporate investments in response to the fed's dual shocks, Financ.

A stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial tested the effectiveness of CATCH for increasing initiation and engagement in post-discharge medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) treatment among hospital patients with opioid use disorder (OUD). The objective of this study was to identify facility characteristics that were associated with stronger performance of CATCH. Methods: This study used a mixed methods multiple-case study design. The six hospitals in the CATCH evaluation were each assigned a case rating according to intervention reach. Reach was considered high if ≥50 % of hospitalized OUD patients received an MOUD order. Cross-case rating comparison identified attributes of high-performing hospitals and inductive and deductive approaches were used to identify themes. Results: Higher-performing hospitals exhibited attributes that were generally absent in lower-performing hospitals, including (1) complete medical provider staffing; (2) designated office space and resources for CATCH; (3) existing integrated OUD treatment resources; and (4) limited overlap between the implementation period and COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: Hospitals with attributes indicative of awareness and integration of OUD services into general care were generally higher performing than hospitals that had siloed OUD treatment programs. Future implementations of addiction consult services may benefit from an increased focus on hospital- and community-level buy-in and efforts to integrate MOUD treatment into general care. © 2024",Addiction consult service;

This waning of immunity has been described in modelling as a lower level of protection. This study incorporated fine-scale vaccine waning into modelling to predict the next surge of the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In Hong Kong, the Omicron subvariant BA.2 caused a significant epidemic wave between February and April 2022, which triggered high vaccination rates. About half a year later, a second outbreak, dominated by a combination of BA.2, BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, began to spread. We developed mathematical equations to formulate continuous changes in vaccine boosting and waning based on empirical serological data. These equations were incorporated into a multi-strain discrete-time Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed model. The daily number of reported cases during the first Omicron outbreak, with daily vaccination rates, the population mobility index and daily average temperature, were used to train the model. The model successfully predicted the size and timing of the second surge and the variant replacement by BA.4/5. It estimated 655,893 cumulative reported cases from June 1, 2022 to 31 October 2022, which was only 2.69% fewer than the observed cumulative number of 674,008. The model projected that increased vaccine protection (by larger vaccine coverage or no vaccine waning) would reduce the size of the second surge of BA.2 infections substantially but would allow more subsequent BA.4/5 infections. Increased vaccine coverage or greater vaccine protection can reduce the infection rate during certain periods when the immune-escape variants co-circulate; however, new immune-escape variants spread more by out-competing the previous strain. © 2024 The Authors",COVID-19; Discrete-time simulation; Epidemic model; Immune-escape; Waning immunity,"Bar-On Y.M., Goldberg Y., Mandel M., Bodenheimer O., Amir O., Freedman L., Alroy-Preis S., Ash N., Huppert A., Milo R., Protection by a fourth dose of BNT162b2 against Omicron in Israel, New England Journal of Medicine, 386, 18, pp. 1712-1720, (2022); Bubar K.M., Reinholt K., Kissler S.M., Lipsitch M., Cobey S., Grad Y.H., Larremore D.B., Model-informed COVID-19 vaccine prioritization strategies by age and serostatus, Science (New York, N.Y.), 371, 6532, pp. 916-921, (2021); Chen X., Bai X., Chen X., Zheng N., Yang J., Zhang J., Yu H., Modeling the prediction on the efficacy of a homologous third dose of CoronaVac against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, and BA.4/5 - China, 2020-2021, China CDC Weekly, 5, 5, pp. 103-107, (2023); Daily count of vaccination by age groups, (2022); The government of Hong Kong special administrative region, (2022); Dick D.W., Childs L., Feng Z., Li J., Rost G., Buckeridge D.L., Ogden N.H., Heffernan J.M., COVID-19 seroprevalence in Canada modelling waning and boosting COVID-19 immunity in Canada a Canadian immunization Research network study, Vaccines, 10, 1, (2021); Esterman A., (2022); Gazit S., Saciuk Y., Perez G., Peretz A., Pitzer V.E., Patalon T., Short term, relative effectiveness of four doses versus three doses of BNT162b2 vaccine in people aged 60 years and older in Israel: Retrospective, test negative, case-control study, BMJ, 377, (2022); He S., Peng Y., Sun K., SEIR modeling of the COVID-19 and its dynamics, Nonlinear Dynamics, 101, 3, pp. 1667-1680, (2020); Imai N., Rawson T., Knock E.S., Sonabend R., Elmaci Y., Perez-Guzman P.N., Whittles L.K., Kanapram D.T., Gaythorpe K.A.M., Hinsley W., Djaafara B.A., Wang H., Fraser K., FitzJohn R.G., Hogan A.B., Doohan P., Ghani A.C., Ferguson N.M., Baguelin M., Cori A., Quantifying the effect of delaying the second COVID-19 vaccine dose in england: A mathematical modelling study, The Lancet Public Health, 8, 3, pp. e174-e183, (2023); Khoury D.S., Cromer D., Reynaldi A., Schlub T.E., Wheatley A.K., Juno J.A., Subbarao K., Kent S.J., Triccas J.A., Davenport M.P., Neutralizing antibody levels are highly predictive of immune protection from symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, Nature Medicine, 27, 7, pp. 1205-1211, (2021); Kojima N., Klausner J.D., Protective immunity after recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection, The Lancet Infectious Diseases, 22, 1, pp. 12-14, (2022); Kwok K.O., Li K.K., Tang A., Tsoi M.T.F., Chan E.Y.Y., Tang J.W.T., Wong A., Wei W.I., Wong S.Y.S., Psychobehavioral responses and likelihood of receiving COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic, Hong Kong, Emerging Infectious Diseases, 27, 7, pp. 1802-1810, (2021); Lau J.J., Cheng S.M.S., Leung K., Lee C.K., Hachim A., Tsang L.C.H., Yam K.W.H., Chaothai S., Kwan K.K.H., Chai Z.Y.H., Lo T.H.K., Mori M., Wu C., Valkenburg S.A., Amarasinghe G.K., Lau E.H.Y., Hui D.S.C., Leung G.M., Peiris M., Wu J.T., Author Correction: Real-world COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against the Omicron BA.2 variant in a SARS-CoV-2 infection-naive population, Nature Medicine, 30, 1, (2024); Levin E.G., Lustig Y., Cohen C., Fluss R., Indenbaum V., Amit S., Doolman R., Asraf K., Mendelson E., Ziv A., Rubin C., Freedman L., Kreiss Y., Regev-Yochay G., Waning immune humoral response to BNT162b2 covid-19 vaccine over 6 months, New England Journal of Medicine, 385, 24, (2021); Liang J.B., Yuan H.Y., Li K.K., Wei W.I., Wong S.Y.S., Tang A., Riley S., Kwok K.O., Path to normality: Assessing the level of social-distancing measures relaxation against antibody-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants in a partially-vaccinated population, Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal, 20, pp. 4052-4059, (2022); Liu K., Lou Y., Optimizing COVID-19 vaccination programs during vaccine shortages, Infectious Disease Modelling, 7, 1, pp. 286-298, (2022); Liu Y., Pearson C.A.B., Sandmann F.G., Barnard R.C., Kim J.H., Flasche S., Jit M., Abbas K., Dosing interval strategies for two-dose COVID-19 vaccination in 13 middle-income countries of Europe: Health impact modelling and benefit-risk analysis, The Lancet Regional Health.

In the Greek educational system, the Montessori method is mainly applied in preschool and primary educational contexts. The main research objective was to investigate the early mathematical competence of students aged 4-7 years old attending a Montessori preschool educational center with those of students aged 4-7 years old attending educational institutions where traditional teaching techniques and methods are being implemented at the Eastern Thessaloniki, Greece. The overall research sample was 142 students, 68 taught in the Montessori institution and 74 attending typical ones, as well as 119 parents of the children that were measured. A questionnaire was administered electronically to the parents who agreed to participate in the research, while the measurements of early mathematical competence were carried out via the Utrecht Early Mathematical Competence Scales. Overall findings showed that the scores of the students attending the Montessori educational institution were higher than those of the ones attending typical educational institutions, especially those of pre-kindergarten, kindergarten, and first-grade children. © 2025, Intelektual Pustaka Media Utama.

Methods: A three-wave study using a sample of 11 to 18-year-olds in China was conducted, with baseline data collected in June 2020 (n = 4156) and follow-ups in December 2020 (n = 3209) and August 2021 (n = 2324). Two temporal cross-lagged panel network models were computed to analyze adolescent learning burnout over time. Results: The predictive pathway of adolescent learning burnout demonstrates significant temporal specificity. In the early outbreak period, Positive thinking, Appreciation of life and Depression are the most influential predictive symptoms. In the normalized epidemic prevention period, Goal planning, Affect control and Positive thinking are the most influential predictive symptoms. However, during this period, the extent to which adolescent learning burnout is predicted by other symptoms in the networks is significantly reduced. Limitations: The samples used in this study are not expected to be nationally representative, and therefore the generalizability of the results may be limited. Conclusions: These findings highlight the predictive roles of Positive thinking, Appreciation of life, and Depression in adolescent learning burnout and the importance of timely intervention on these symptoms in the early outbreak period of public health emergency similar to the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings also illustrate the essentiality of eliminate unstable factors in the school environment during the normalized epidemic prevention period. © 2024",Adolescent; CLPN; Depression; Learning burnout; Posttraumatic growth; Resilience,"Ahola K., Hakanen J., Job strain, burnout, and depressive symptoms: a prospective study among dentists, J.

This study conducted comprehensive observations in Zhengzhou from April 26 to May 11, 2022. Low NOx concentrations were observed during the Covid epidemic period (EP) (10.4 ± 3.0 ppb), compared to the pre-epidemic period (PEP) (12.5 ± 3.8 ppb). The mean HONO concentration during EP (0.53 ± 0.34 ppb) was 0.09 ppb lower than that during PEP (0.62 ± 0.53 ppb). The decrease in HONO concentration during EP came mainly at night due to the reduction in the direct emission (Pemi) (0.03 ppb/hr), the homogeneous reaction between •OH and NO (POH+NO) (0.02 ppb/hr), and the heterogeneous conversion of NO2 on the ground (0.01 ppb/hr). Notably, there was no significant change in daytime HONO concentration. The daytime HONO budget indicated that the primary HONO sources during PEP were the nitrate photolysis (Pnitrate), followed by the POH+NO, Pemi, the photo-enhanced reaction of NO2 on the ground (Pground+hv) and aerosol surface (Paerosol+hv). The primary HONO sources were Pnitrate, POH+NO, Pemi, and Paerosol+hv during EP, respectively. The missing source has a high correlation with solar radiation, there might be other photo-related HONO sources or the contributions of photosensitized reactions were underestimated. In the extremely underestimated cases, HONO production rates from the Pnitrate, Pground+hv, and Paerosol+hv increased by 0.17, 0.10, and 0.10 ppb/hr during PEP, 0.23, 0.13, and 0.16 ppb/hr during EP, and Pnitrate was still the primary source during both PEP and EP. © 2024",COVID-19; HONO budget; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrous acid; Unknown sources,"Acker K., Moller D., Wieprecht W., Meixner F.X., Bohn B., Gilge S., Et al., Strong daytime production of OH from HNO<sub>2</sub> at a rural mountain site, Geophys.

This study included 88 patients with acute COVID-19 infection from Egypt. They were classified in to 3 groups with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 manifestation. Patients subjected to full history taking and clinical examination, CT scans of the chest, PCR test for Covid19 and blood sampling for vitamin D and Comprehensive inflammatory markers analysis. The present study reported statistically significant increase of age, dyspnea and respiratory rate (p <0.05) in sever infected groups than mild or moderate groups of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the primary analysis outcome was significantly associated mortality with reduced hemoglobin levels and elevated values of white blood cells, platelets, D-dimer, LDH, ferritin, blood urea and increased Prothrombin Time (p <0.05). However, insignificant statistical difference was found between the measured serum levels of Vitamin D in patients who recovered from those who died (96.58-± 38.34 vs 100.75 ± 80.62). This study concluded that COVID-19 severity correlates with multiple inflammatory biomarkers and coagulation factors. While the evidence concerning the therapeutic effect of vitamin D on the outcomes of acute respiratory infections is still controversial but a causal link between level of Vitamin D and the risk of COVID-19 severity and mortality not entirely excluded. ©2025 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC)",COVID-19; Inflammatory markers; Mortality; Patients; Vitamin D,"Hassanain N.A., Hassanain M.A., Ahmed W.M., Shaapan R.M., Barakat A.M., El-Fadaly H.A., Public health importance of foodborne pathogens, World Journal Medical Science, 9, 4, pp. 208-222, (2013); Girh Z.M.S.A, Shaapan R.M., Overview of Aspergillosis in Poultry - A Review, Egyptian Journal of Veterinary Sciences, 55, 2, pp. 407-419, (2024); Toaleb N.I., Shaapan R.M., Zoonotic Protozoan Parasites Infecting Camels, Diagnosis and Control–A Review, Egyptian Journal of Veterinary Sciences, 55, 4, pp. 1131-1142, (2024); Abouelsoued D.M., Shaapan R.M., Elkhateeb R.M.M., Elnattat W.S., Hammam A.M., Therapeutic efficacy of ginger (Zingiber officinale), ginseng (Panax ginseng) and sage (Salvia officinalis) against Cryptosporidium parvum in experimentally infected mice, Egyptian Journal of Veterinary Sciences, 51, 2, pp. 241-251, (2020); Shaapan R.M., Toaleb N.I., Abdel-Rahman E.H., Detection of Toxoplasma gondii-specific immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies in meat juice of beef, Iraqi Journal of Veterinary, 35, pp. 319-324, (2021); Hassanain M.A., Shaapan R.M., Khalil F.A.M., Sero-epidemiological value of some hydatid cyst antigen in diagnosis of human cystic echinococcosis, Journal of Parasitic Diseases, 40, 1, pp. 52-56, (2016); Mahmoud M.A., Ghazy A.A., Shaapan R.M., Review of diagnostic procedures and control of some viral diseases causing abortion and infertility in small ruminants in Egypt, Iraqi Journal of Veterinary Science, 35, pp. 513-521, (2021); Atta E.B., Ghazy A.A., Shaapan R.M., Equine Herpesvirus-1 Infection, Clinical Features, Treatment and Control, Advances in Animal and Veterinary Sciences, 8, 6, pp. 668-679, (2020); Salman M.B., Salah Eldin D.A., Zin Eldin A.I.A., Shaapan R.M., Ata E.B., Elaadli H., Prevalence, Virulence Determinants and Antimicrobial Resistance Genes of Staphylococcus aureus Strains Isolated from Retail Market Fish and Their Handlers in Egypt, Egyptian Journal of Aquatic Biology and Fisheries, 28, 1, pp. 1101-1118, (2024); Shell W.S, Saad M.A., Abd El-Razik K.A., Sayedm M.L., Shaapan R.M., Brucella ovis as a Common Antigen for Rapid Diagnosis of Rough Brucellosis in Cattle and Sheep, Research Journal of Microbiology, 7, 1, pp. 68-74, (2012); Shaapan R.M., Hassanain M.A., Khalil F.A.M., Modified agglutination test for serologic survey of Toxoplasma gondii infection in goats and water buffaloes in Egypt, Research Journal of Parasitololgy, 5, pp. 13-17, (2010); Bardhan M., Ray I., Roy S., Bhatt P., Patel S., Asri S., Shariff S., Shree A., Mitra S., Roy P., Anand A., Emerging zoonotic diseases and COVID-19 pandemic: global Perspective and Indian Scenario, Annals of Medicine and Surgery, 85, pp. 3997-4004, (2023); Li Q., Guan X., Wu P., Wang X., Zhou L., Tong Y., Ren R., Leung K.S., Lau E.H., Wong J.Y., Xing X., Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus–infected pneumonia, New England Journal of Medicine, 382, 13, pp. 1199-1207, (2020); Swenson K.E., Swenson E.R., Pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome and COVID-19 lung injury, Critical Care Clinics, 37, 4, pp. 749-776, (2021); Nile S.H., Nile A., Qiu J., Li L., Jia X., Kai G., COVID-19: Pathogenesis, cytokine storm and therapeutic potential of interferons, Cytokine & Growth Factor Reviews, 53, pp. 66-70, (2020); Zayed N.E., Abbas A., Lutfy S.M., Criteria and potential predictors of severity in patients with COVID-19, The Egyptian Journal of Bronchology, 16, 1, (2022); Hou H., Zhang B., Huang H., Luo Y., Wu S., Tang G., Liu W., Mao L., Mao L., Wang F., Sun Z., Using IL-2R/lymphocytes for predicting the clinical progression of patients with COVID-19, Clinical & Experimental Immunology, 201, 1, pp. 76-84, (2020); Elfadaly H.A., Shaapan R.

As a result, interdisciplinary methods have become a requisite for numerous higher education actors and are likely to produce faster and more complex knowledge acquisition and research results, irrespective of the application field. Using the literature criticism method, we set the general framework and highlight the necessity of crossdisciplinary approaches to engage and prepare students and support scholarly endeavors. Following the experience-based learning methodology, we set the context for our case study approach derived from a digital humanities R&D project outlining its interdisciplinary learning potential with benefits for students studying sciences and humanities. The analysis provides a detailed overview of its application in research in education and applicability to active learning methods for group work such as SCALE-UP. © 2025 Common Ground Research Networks.

In the complex structure (Co1), the cobalt ion is in 2+ oxidation state and is coordinated with ONNO donor set on the thiosemicarbazone backbone. The complex molecule crystallizes in the space group P21/m and the environment of the cobalt center tends to square planar geometry. The inhibitory performance of SARS-CoV-2 and the anti-inflammatory impact of the complex molecule were investigated. It was found that Co1 has high inhibitory effects on the SARS-CoV-2 virus's 3CL main protease enzyme, ACE2:SARS-CoV2 Spike RBD interaction, and IL8. Also, it showed significant anti-inflammatory effects on the release of IL6, IL8, IL10, and TGFβ1 cytokines and wound healing during in vitro TNF-α-induced inflammation. Experimental evidence demonstrates that Co1 diminishes both IL8 gene expression and protein levels. According to in silico and experimental results, it has a drug potential. Assessing the in vivo impacts of Co1 might contribute to understanding its potential as an antiviral and anti-inflammatory agent. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Cobalt; COVID19; IL8; Inflammation; SARS-CoV-2; Thiosemicarbazone,"Asbell P.A., Epstein S.P., Wallace J.A., Epstein D., Stewart C.C., Burger R.M., Efficacy of cobalt chelates in the rabbit eye model for epithelial herpetic keratitis, Cornea, 17, pp. 550-557, (1998); Delehanty J.B., Bongard J.E., Thach D.C., Knight D.A., Hickey T.E., Chang E.L., Antiviral properties of cobalt(III)-complexes, Bioorg.

Detecting the infectious part of the lungs using computerized tomography (CT) images has become an instantaneous detection method. In this article, a Hybrid Classification Optimization (HCO) using Recurrent Leaning and Fuzzy (RLF) is proposed. The neural network classifies infected and non-infected regions using pixel distributions and their variations. This is performed by identifying missing features and training the recurrent network using regional differences. Based on the feature availability, recurrent learning classifies the region through the input dataset and recurrent training correlation. The fuzzy predicts missing features through substituted derivatives obtained between wide ranges of variations. In this process, the maximum fuzzy derivatives for feature substitution are used for infected region prediction. The least fuzzy derivatives are prevented from the training layer to reduce false rates in region classification. This joint process improves the training consistency to leverage the detection and region classification accuracies. The proposed HCO-RLF improves detection and classification accuracy, and precision by 11.96 %, 9.98 %, and 13.42 % for the varying classification rates. Besides, the results are obtained in comparison with the existing DR-MIL, DSAE, and BS-FSA methods discussed later in the article. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",COVID detection; CT image; Feature extraction; Fuzzy derivatives; Recurrent network,"Sundaram S.G., Aloyuni S.A., Alharbi R.A., Alqahtani T., Sikkandar M.Y., Subbiah C., Deep transfer learning based unified framework for COVID19 classification and infection detection from chest X-ray images, Arab.

The geographical heterogeneity of HIV infection and the impact of COVID-19 on the diagnosis of HIV at regional level are important to understand. This study aimed to estimate the HIV incidence by geographical region and understand how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced diagnosis of HIV. Methods: We used an extended back-calculation method to reconstruct the epidemiological dynamics of HIV/AIDS by geographical region. We used eight regions: Tokyo, the capital of Japan, Hokkaido plus Tohoku, Kanto plus Koshinetsu (excluding Tokyo), Hokuriku, Tokai, Kinki, Chugoku plus Shikoku, and Kyushu plus Okinawa. Four different epidemiological measurements were evaluated: (i) estimated HIV incidence, (ii) estimated rate of diagnosis, (iii) number of undiagnosed HIV infections, and (iv) proportion of HIV infections that had been diagnosed. Results: The incidence of HIV/AIDS during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 to 2022 increased in all regions except Kanto/Koshinetsu (51.3 cases/year), Tokyo (183.9 cases/year), Hokuriku (1.0 cases/year), and Tokai (43.1 cases/year). The proportion of HIV infections that had been diagnosed only exceeded 90% in Tokyo (91.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 90.6, 93.3), Kanto/Koshinetsu (91.0%, 95% CI: 87.3, 97.8), and Kinki (92.5%, 95% CI: 90.4, 95.9). The proportion of infections that had been diagnosed was estimated at 83.3% (95% CI: 75.1, 98.7) in Chugoku/Shikoku and 80.5% (95% CI: 73.9, 91.0) in Kyusyu/Okinawa. Conclusions: In urban regions with major metropolitan cities, including Tokyo, Kinki, and Kanto/Koshinetsu, the number of undiagnosed HIV infections is substantial. However, the proportion of undiagnosed infections was estimated to be smaller than in other regions. The diagnosed proportion was the lowest in Kyusyu/Okinawa (80.5%), followed by Chugoku/Shikoku and Hokkaido/Tohoku. The level of diagnosis in those regional prefectures may have been more influenced and damaged by the COVID-19 pandemic than in urban settings. © 2024 The Authors",AIDS; Community; Geographical variations; Heterogeneity; Incidence; Statistical estimation,"Aalen O.O., Farewell V.T., De Angelis D., Day N.E., Gill O.N., A markov model for HIV disease progression including the effect of HIV diagnosis and treatment: Application to AIDS prediction in england and wales, Statistics in Medicine, 16, 19, pp. 2191-2210, (1997); (2023); Boldsen J.L., Jensen J.L., Sogaard J., Sorensen M., On the incubation time distribution and the Danish AIDS data, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series A, 151, 1, pp. 42-43, (1988); Brookmeyer R., Gail M.H., Minimum size of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic in the United States, Lancet (London, England), 2, 8519, pp. 1320-1322, (1986); Brookmeyer R., Gail M.H., A method for obtaining short-term projections and lower bounds on the size of the AIDS epidemic, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 83, 402, pp. 301-308, (1988); Brookmeyer R., Goedert J.J., Censoring in an epidemic with an application to hemophilia-associated AIDS, Biometrics, 45, 1, pp. 325-335, (1989); Ejima K., Koizumi Y., Yamamoto N., Rosenberg M., Ludema C., Bento A.I., Yoneoka D., Ichikawa S., Mizushima D., Iwami S., HIV testing by public health centers and municipalities and new HIV cases during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes, 87, 2, pp. e182-e187, (2021); Granich R.M., Gilks C.F., Dye C., Williams B.G., Universal voluntary HIV testing with immediate antiretroviral therapy as a strategy for elimination of HIV transmission: A mathematical model, Lancet (London, England), 373, 9657, pp. 48-57, (2009); Granich R., Williams B., Montaner J., Zuniga J.M., 90-90-90 and ending AIDS: Necessary and feasible, Lancet (London, England), 390, 10092, pp. 341-343, (2017); Habila M.A., Obeng-Kusi M., Ali M.J., Magaji F.A., Shambe I.H., Daru P.H., Jacobs E.T., Madhivanan P., Sagay A.S., Musa J., The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on routine HIV care and cervical cancer screening in North-Central Nigeria, BMC Women's Health, 23, 1, (2023); Heunis C., Chikobvu P., Muteba M., Kigozi-Male G., Engelbrecht M., Mushori P., Impact of COVID-19 on selected essential public health services - lessons learned from a retrospective record review in the Free State, South Africa, BMC Health Services Research, 23, 1, (2023); Iwamoto A., Taira R., Yokomaku Y., Koibuchi T., Rahman M., Izumi Y., Tadokoro K., The HIV care cascade: Japanese perspectives, PLoS One, 12, 3, (2017); Number and trend of public health center establishments, (2023); Joves P.J.M., Matulac M.O., Pagcatipunan R.S., Barriers to antiretroviral medication adherence in people living with HIV (PLHIV) at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease, 8, 10, (2023); Kimanga D.O., Makory V.N.B., Hassan A.S., Ngari F., Ndisha M.M., Muthoka K.J., Odero L., Omoro G.O., Aoko A., Ng'ang'a L., Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on routine HIV care and antiretroviral treatment outcomes in Kenya: A nationally representative analysis, PLoS One, 18, 11, (2023); Matsumoto S., Nagai M., Tran L.K., Yamaoka K., Nguyen H.D.T., Tanuma J., Pham T.N., Oka S., Van Tran G., Multicenter observational survey on psychosocial and behavioral impacts of COVID-19 in people living with HIV in Northern Vietnam, Scientific Reports, 13, 1, (2023); Number of public health centers by establishing entity, (2023); Munoz A., Xu J., Models for the incubation of AIDS and variations according to age and period, Statistics in Medicine, 15, 21-22, pp. 2459-2473, (1996); Nair G., Celum C., Szydlo D., Brown E.R., Et al., Adherence, safety, and choice of the monthly dapivirine vaginal ring or oral emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis among african adolescent girls and young women: A randomised, open-label, crossover trial, The lancet.

Each crystal unit cell has four molecules. There are two piperidine rings: one in the chair conformation and another one in the boat conformation. The piperidine nitrogen in the boat conformation is joined to the oxygen-containing chair conformation piperidine ring to produce the oxaquinuclidine ring (-N-CH2O-). Furthermore, because of the steric barrier between rings, all aryl groups are oriented in an equatorial position. The crystal network is maintained through several interactions, including C—H⋯O/N/Cl/π. The crystal void and interaction energy studies gave additional evidence of the strength of the crystal packing and intermolecular linkage. Crystal 3b has less cavity than crystal 3c, indicating that it is densely packed. The dispersion energy contribution dominates the stability, according to the analysis of the electrostatic, dispersion, and total energy frameworks. Reduced density gradient (RDG), electron localization function (ELF), and localized orbital locator (LOL) analysis were used to determine the molecular interaction, electron pair density, and maximally localized orbitals overlapping sites, respectively. This approach reveals that oxaquinuclidine ring steric hindrance and the electron densities throughout the molecules. Density function theory (DFT) provides more evidence for the ring's orientation and the molecules' reactivity. A molecular docking investigation of four essential COVID-19 proteins was carried out using these theoretical ideas. This investigation demonstrates that each protein's reactivity varies; certain proteins have more interaction with high electron density molecules (electron-donating substituent), while others have more interaction with low electron density molecules (electron-withdrawing substituent). The ADMET and drug-likeness investigations reveal that methoxy group substituted molecules perfectly correlate with the required pharmacological characteristics. The cytotoxicity of the five compounds was assessed using the HEK293T cell. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",COVID-19 protein docking; Crystal structure; Hirshfeld surface; Interaction energy; NCI-RDG; Piperidine,"Gates B., Responding to Covid-19-A Once-in-a-Century Pandemic, N.

Theoretical arguments and empirical findings suggest that videoconference interviews may lead to different interview performance ratings in comparison to Face-to-Face (FTF) interviews. This has led to the question of the comparability of the psychometric properties of videoconferences and FTF interviews. However, evidence from actual selection processes stems from the beginning of the century, and recent findings predominantly stem from simulated interview contexts. We present insights from an actual selection process within a large European organization where we had the unique opportunity for a quasi-experimental investigation of differences between videoconference and FTF interviews. Initially, the organization conducted FTF interviews, and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the interviews were conducted via videoconference. We examine mean differences in applicant performance ratings and evidence for response format-related validity differences. There were only small, non-significant mean differences and no evidence for response format related validity differences. We discuss possible causes for discrepancies in our findings compared to previous research. Furthermore, we conclude that downstream consequences of differences between FTF and videoconference interviews may be lower than previously expected. We end with a call for research on the interaction between technology-design and selection-tool-design features. © 2024 The Author(s).

It focuses on developing predictive models to forecast stock prices accurately, vital for mitigating losses and maximizing gains amidst the inherent unpredictability and volatility of the market. The study comprehensively analyzes various predictive models, including time series analysis and advanced machine learning techniques. It highlights the superiority of ensemble or hybrid models in enhancing prediction reliability. Central to this research is the development of a model incorporating detailed data collection, thorough analysis, and state-of-the-art machine learning methods, achieving notable predictive accuracy. This approach underscores the benefits of data-centric strategies in today's rapidly evolving business environment and the widespread applicability of predictive analytics. The model outperforms conventional methods by decomposing time series into simpler components and optimizing hyperparameters, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy, as demonstrated by performance testing on the S&P 500 and CSI 300 indices. The RMSE, MAE, and R2 values of the MEME-AO-LSTM model are 27.12, 19.43, and 0.992, respectively, which serve as evidence of this. The model's generalizability and high performance are demonstrated by its efficacy in a variety of major markets, including the NASDAQ 100, Nikkei 225, FTSE, DAX, SSE, and KOSPI. Additionally, the model's adaptability under diverse market conditions is demonstrated through its evaluation of its robustness in response to significant events, such as the economic stimulus responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and the geopolitical tensions resulting from the tension and conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Consequently, the proposed methodology has the potential to help investors achieve substantial and advantageous returns. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Aquila Optimizer; CSI 300; Financial Markets; Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition; S&P 500; Stock price,"Abualigah L., Yousri D., Abd Elaziz M., Ewees A.A., Al-qaness M.A.A., Gandomi A.H., Aquila Optimizer: A novel meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, Computers & Industrial Engineering, 157, (2021); Ahuja R., Kumar Y., Goyal S., Kaur S., Sachdeva R.K., Solanki V., Stock Price Prediction By Applying Machine Learning Techniques, International Conference on Emerging Smart Computing and Informatics (ESCI), 2023, pp. 1-5, (2023); Ali M., Khan D.M., Alshanbari H.M., El-Bagoury A.-A.-A.-H., Prediction of complex stock market data using an improved hybrid emd-lstm model, Applied Sciences, 13, 3, (2023); Andrada-Felix J., Fernandez-Rodriguez F., Sosvilla-Rivero S., A crisis like no other?

To control the imported epidemic, it is necessary to accurately predict the number of imported cases from different source countries. This paper proposes a novel time series prediction approach called PNICA (Prediction on Number of Imported CAses) that uses deep learning to predict the number of COVID-19 imported cases. On the one hand, the proposed PNICA approach adopts a multi-modal learning strategy to fuse three sources of data: flight data, the epidemic data, and the data of historical imported cases. On the other hand, the proposed PNICA approach extends the traditional transformer model with cross-modal attention to learn the interactions between different data modalities to improve prediction accuracy. We use China as the target country and collect the number of imported cases from four source countries—Japan, USA, Russia, and the UK—as well as the epidemic data and flight data from May to November 2020. Experiments on the collected data demonstrate that the proposed PNICA approach outperforms the baseline methods in predicting the number of imported cases. The ablation study shows that both the multi-modal learning strategy and cross-modal attention can significantly improve prediction performance. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",COVID-19; Cross-modal attention; Imported case prediction;

Objective: to identify class or profiles of patients hospitalized and treated with COVID-19 pneumonia using latent class clustering methods to assess the clinical and prognostic relevance of the resulting patients’ profiles. Poor prognosis was defined as death or need for ICU admission, good prognosis, the opposite. With special interest in differential responses to calcifediol. Setting: Reina Sofia University Hospital, Córdoba Spain. Patients: Retrospective observational cohort study of patients admitted for COVID-19. ClinicalTrials.gov public database (NCT05819918). Inclusion criteria: (i) Age ≥ 18 and ≤ 90 years, (ii) Pneumonia characterized by the presence of infiltrates on chest X-ray or CT scan, (iii) SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed, and (iv) CURB Scale 65 >1. Design: Latent class analysis, for obtaining homogeneous clusters, without specifying a priori the belonging group, and selecting the optimal number of clusters by minimizing information criteria. Evaluating the differences between groups for each variable by means of chi-square, Fisher's exact test and Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: 707 patients hospitalized from 10 March 2020 until 4 March 2022 were included. For the treatment variable, differences were found between class 3 (60 % treated with calcifediol only) and classes 1 (less than 1 % calcifediol only vs. 82 % treated with both), 2 (less than 1 % calcifediol only vs. 82 % treated with both) and 4 (1 % calcifediol only vs. 84 % treated with both). Class 3, (60 % with calcifediol), had a significantly better prognosis compared to patients treated with glucocorticoids alone (OR: 15.2, 95 % CI: [3.73–142], p<0.001) or no treatment (OR: 7.38, 95 % CI: [2.63–30.2], p<0.001). Conclusions: our real-life study shows that calcifediol treatment significantly reduces the need for ICU admission and improved prognosis in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia, especially in the profile of patients receiving it without glucocorticoids. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Calcifediol; Corticoids; COVID-19; COVID-treatment; Latent class analysis; SARS-CoV-2; Vitamin D,"Zhu N., Zhang D., Wang W., Li X., Yang B., Song J., Zhao X., Huang B., Shi W., Lu R., Niu P., Zhan F., Ma X., Wang D., Xu W., Wu G., Gao G.F., Tan W., A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019, N.

And it highly affects the most vulnerable groups such as women and children. This study explored the lived experiences of teacher-education student-mothers of a state university in the Philippines towards the end of the pandemic using a phenomenological approach. Twenty-one student-mothers voluntarily participated in the study who were i) bona fide students of the campus, ii) biological mothers, iii) married or living together with a partner, and iv) living with their child. From the data analyses, four major themes emerged: i) unexpected pregnancy, ii) heightened stress during the pandemic, iii) maintaining a positive outlook in life, and iv) managing dual roles. These results implied that the teacher-education student-mothers were highly stressed during the pandemic but they had extrinsic motivators to finish studies such as their children and family. The lived experiences of teacher-education student-mothers can serve as an inspiration to other students to pursue their studies even amid adversities. It is recommended that there must be an enhancement of student services tailored to support the mental health of marginalized students. © 2025, Intelektual Pustaka Media Utama.

However, uptake of influenza, pertussis and Covid-19 vaccinations offered during pregnancy is below the desired rate. This research aims to explore UK midwives’ experiences of approaching and discussing vaccinations with pregnant women, and their perceived role in pregnant women's vaccination decisions. Methods: Midwives in the West Midlands, UK were recruited via participating hospitals and midwife specific social media groups. Interviews were conducted remotely from April to July 2023 and analysed with a deductive codebook coding strategy using thematic analysis. Findings: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 midwives identifying the following key themes: Recommendations to have vaccinations reported on the contents of recommendations and how they are communicated; Messages and guidance included the importance of up-to-date informational needs for midwives to administer vaccinations and the barriers caused by uncertainty and conflicting messages about the Covid-19 vaccine during pregnancy; Delivery of vaccinations included the convenience of offering vaccinations during standard antenatal appointments; and Midwives’ barriers explored the pandemic specific and other barriers midwives face in the administering of vaccinations. Discussion: These findings contribute to the understanding of how midwives discuss the topic of vaccinations with pregnant women. This research highlights the importance for midwives to receive clear and consistent information. A strong emphasis on why vaccines are important when recommending to pregnant women in addition to standard information on the availability and timing may have a bearing in helping women to make informed decisions about accepting vaccinations. © 2024 The Authors",Antenatal;

If the primary osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture is not treated promptly, it develops into an old osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture with nonunion over time. OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of percutaneous vertebroplasty in nine patients with old osteoporotic lumbar compression fracture with nonunion. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of nine elderly patients with old osteoporotic lumbar compression fractures with nonunion treated in the Orthopedics Department of Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from September 2018 to August 2022. All patients underwent revision treatment with percutaneous vertebroplasty and received regular anti-osteoporosis treatment and rehabilitation training. The lumbar spine X-ray plain film and three-dimensional CT test results were reviewed before discharge and during follow-up to evaluate the diffusion of bone cement. Visual analog scale score, lumbar Oswestry disability index score, and Roussouly classification were recorded before, after surgery and during follow-up. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) During postoperative follow-up, none of the 9 cases in this group experienced serious surgical complications such as nerve injury, infection, bone cement leakage, pulmonary embolism, and allergic shock, and no adverse reactions related to bone cement occurred. One patient died of respiratory failure due to COVID-19 infection 2 years after operation. (2) The visual analog scale score and Oswestry disability index score of postoperative pain in patients with recurrent vertebral fractures after percutaneous vertebroplasty were significantly lower than those before revision surgery. After the last follow-up percutaneous vertebroplasty revision surgery, the Roussouly classification of patients significantly improved. There was no statistically significant difference between the changes in vertebral body height during the last follow-up measurement and preoperative comparison. (3) These findings indicate that for patients with old osteoporotic lumbar compression fractures with nonunion, moderate injection of bone cement and effective dispersion of bone cement have a significant relieving effect on postoperative pain. Regular anti-osteoporosis and effective postoperative rehabilitation training can help patients improve their postoperative lumbar spine function. © 2025, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

College student, especially freshmen, are particularly susceptible to experiencing intense mental stress reactions during a pandemic. We aimed to identify stable and intervenable variables including academic, relationship and economic factors, and focused on their impact on mental health severity during the pandemic period. Methods: We innovatively combined diverse machine learning methods, including XGBoost, SHAP, and K-means clustering, to predict the mental health severity of college freshmen. A total of 3281 college freshmen participated in the research. Discriminant analyses were performed on groups of participants with depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7). All characteristic variables were selected based on their importance and interventionability. Further analyses were conducted with selected features to determine the optimal variable combination. Results: XGBoost analysis revealed that relationship factors exhibited the highest predictive capacity for mental health severity among college freshmen (SHAPFamily Relationship = 0.373; SHAPPeer Support = 0.236). The impact of academic factors on college freshmen's mental health severity depended on their intricate interplay with relationship factors, resulting in complex interactive effects. These effects were heterogeneous among different subgroups. Conclusions: The proposed machine learning approach utilizing XGBoost, SHAP and K-means clustering methods provides a valuable tool to gain insights into the relative contributions of academic, relationship and economic factors to Chinese college freshmen's mental health severity during the COVID-19 pandemic. The result guide the development of targeted intervention measures tailored to meet specific requirements within each subgroup. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Machine learning; Mental health severity; Pandemic; Relationship,"Albright J.N., Hurd N.M., Constellations of social support among underrepresented college students: associations with mental health[J], Appl.

This study analyzed the behaviors of 30 gym attendees to establish a connection between exercise intensity and virus exposure. Close interactions among participants were tracked using self-developed wearable devices that utilized computer vision technologies, while surface-contact behaviors were recorded using video cameras. A multi-route transmission model for respiratory infectious diseases was subsequently created, integrating the observed behaviors. The Omicron variant of COVID-19 served as a case study to evaluate infection risk via various transmission routes and to assess the efficacy of interventions. The METs during physical activity were about 3.5 times higher than those recorded at rest. The average interpersonal distance during close interactions in the gym was measured at 0.82 m, with 36.7 % of interactions occurring face-to-face. On average, the participants made contact with surfaces 770.3 times per hour, with 517.5 of these contacts involving public surfaces. The hourly infection rate was calculated at 18.5 %, with long-range airborne transmission and close contact accounting for 70.1 % and 28.5 % of the cases, respectively. To mitigate transmission risk, several intervention scenarios were modeled. These included (1) 100 % mask-wearing with N95 masks and occupancy reduced to 62 % (25 m2/person); (2) 100 % mask-wearing with surgical masks and occupancy reduced to 26 % (59.6 m2/person); (3) no mask-wearing, with occupancy reduced to 18 % (86.1 m2/person). All scenarios fulfilled the criteria for achieving an Rt below 1, indicating that under these conditions, gyms could be reopened safely. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",COVID-19; Epidemic prevention and control; Gym; Human behavior; Metabolic equivalent (MET),"Zhang Y., Wu W., Li Y., Li Y., An investigation of PM2. 5 concentration changes in Mid-Eastern China before and after COVID-19 outbreak, Environ.

Extensive studies have been conducted to investigate the factors influencing the composition and diversity of AM. However, the knowledge of AM with anthropogenic activities has not reach a consensus. In this study, we took advantage of the dramatic decline of outdoor anthropogenic activities resulting from COVID-19 lockdown to reveal their associations. We collected airborne particulate matter before and during the lockdown period in two cities. The results showed that it was fungal diversity and communities but not bacteria obviously different between pre-lockdown and lockdown samples, suggesting that airborne fungi were more susceptible to anthropogenic activities than bacteria. However, after the implementation of lockdown, the co-occurrence networks of both bacterial and fungal community became more complex, which might be due to the variation of microbial sources. Furthermore, Mantel test and correlation analysis showed that air pollutants also partly contributed to microbial alterations. Airborne fungal community was more affected by air pollutants than bacterial community. Notably, some human pathogens like Nigrospora and Arthrinium were negatively correlated with air pollutants. Overall, our study highlighted the more impacts of anthropogenic activities on airborne fungal community than bacterial community and advanced the understanding of associations between anthropogenic activities and AM. © 2024",Air pollutants; Airborne microorganisms; Anthropogenic activities; COVID-19 lockdown; Response,"Abdel Hameed A.A., Khoder M.I., Ibrahim Y.H., Saeed Y., Osman M.E., Ghanem S., Study on some factors affecting survivability of airborne fungi, Sci.

The COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant increase in sales of dietary supplements, including ginseng supplements, to purportedly support immune health and provide other health benefits. However, this heightened demand has subsequently increased the risk of adulteration in these dietary supplements. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of a novel combination of DNA barcoding and multiplex PCR to identify species in ginseng supplements. A total of 50 commercial ginseng supplements containing Panax ginseng, Panax quinquefolius, or Panax notoginseng were obtained from an online vendor. Two composite samples per product were subjected to DNA extraction followed by multiplex PCR and DNA barcoding with three genetic targets (i.e., rbcL, matK, and ITS2). Of the three DNA barcoding markers, ITS2 had the highest amplification success at 74%, and matK had the highest sequencing success at 60%. DNA barcoding alone identified species in 68% of products, while multiplex PCR had an overall 60% identification rate. The combination of both methods resulted in a 72% species identification rate. In addition to improving the overall identification rate, the combination of both methods allowed for greater species resolution and the detection of undeclared plant species. Future research should explore combining DNA-based methods with chemical-based approaches to improve ginseng detection capabilities and enable the quantification of undeclared adulterants. © 2024 The Authors",Adulteration; Dietary supplements; DNA barcoding; Ginseng; Multiplex PCR; Species identification,"Baeg I.H., The global ginseng market and Korean ginseng, Journal of Ginseng Culture, 4, pp. 1-12, (2022); Bauer T., Weller P., Hammes W.P., Hertel C., The effect of processing parameters on DNA degradation in food, European Food Research and Technology, 217, 4, pp. 338-343, (2003); Begg P., Wheatley V., Fraud in dietary supplements, Food fraud: A global threat with Public health and economic Consequence, pp. 351-360, (2021); Chen W., Balan P., Popovich D.G., Comparison of ginsenoside components of various tissues of New Zealand forest-grown Asian ginseng and American ginseng, Biomolecules, 10, 3, (2020); A DNA barcode for land plants, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 106, 31, pp. 12794-12797, (2009); Chen S.-L., Yao H., Han J., Liu C., Song J., Shi L., Zhu Y., Ma X., Gao T., Pang X., Luo K., Li X., Jia X., Lin Y., Leon C., Validation of the ITS2 region as a novel DNA barcode for identifying medicinal plant species, PLoS One, 5, 1, (2010); Chen S.L., Yin X.M., Han J.P., Sun W., Yao H., Song J.Y., Li X.W., DNA barcoding in herbal medicine: Retrospective and prospective, Journal of Pharmaceutical Analysis, 13, 5, pp. 431-441, (2023); Costion C., Ford A., Cross H., Crayn D., Harrington M., Lowe A., Plant DNA barcodes can accurately estimate species richness in poorly known floras, PLoS One, 6, 11, (2011); Fazekas A., Kuzmina M., Newmaster S., Hollingsworth P., DNA barcoding methods for land plants, Methods in Molecular Biology, 106, 31, pp. 223-252, (2012); Global Biodiversity information Facility, (2024); Guo H.B., Cui X.M., An N., Cai G.P., Sanchi ginseng (Panax notoginseng (Burkill) F.

Understanding this process is crucial for anticipating crises’ effects and implementing mitigative strategies. Specific economic sectors may be major crisis propagators: banking and insurance are often considered decisive in this context. This study employs Dynamic Bayesian Networks to model sectoral interdependencies within the U.S. economy, utilizing daily data from nine Dow Jones industrial indices over the period 2000–2020. As a secondary objective, we evaluate whether the insurance industry plays a central role in spreading crises. Several crisis periods are analyzed, from dot-com bubble to Covid-19 pandemic. The results reveal the subprime crisis, European debt crisis and the 2016 presidential election as the main contagious periods. The last analyzed period – Covid-19 pandemic – was divided in two phases, showing, on phase 1, an interconnected economic system with three main spreaders (Oil & Gas, Real Estate and Pharmaceutical) and, on phase 2, the same configuration of the post-subprime. Furthermore, although the insurance sector was somehow relevant during subprime crisis, it primarily acts as a contagion receptor, specially from the banking sector, with the correlation between them being the highest of all, reaching 0.49 at the last period. © 2024",Contagion;

Although symptom severity varies, some individuals remain asymptomatic. This virus has sparked a global pandemic, imposing a substantial rate of mortality or morbidity, with extended periods of illness reported. People with underlying medical issues and the elderly are more likely to experience adverse results. The virus's frequent mutations pose challenges for medical professionals, necessitating adaptable therapeutic and preventive strategies. Vitamin D, a versatile regulatory molecule, not only influences physiological processes such as serum calcium regulation but also exhibits immunomodulatory functions. Calcium ions play a crucial role as secondary signal transduction molecules, impacting diverse cellular functions and maintaining homeostasis through ion channel regulation. Parathormone, another key regulator of serum calcium, often acts antagonistically to vitamin D. This review delves into the interplay of vitamin D, calcium, and parathormone, exploring their possible influence on the progression of COVID-19. The intricate signaling involving these elements contributes to adverse prognosis, emphasizing the need for comprehensive understanding. Monitoring and controlling these physiological factors and associated pathways have shown the potential to alter disease outcomes, underscoring the importance of a holistic approach. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Calcium; Immune evasion; Immune response; Parathormone; SARS-CoV-2; Vitamin D,"Wu J.T., Leung K., Leung G.M., Nowcasting and forecasting the potential domestic and international spread of the 2019-nCoV outbreak originating in Wuhan, China: a modelling study, Lancet, 395, pp. 689-697, (2020); Hui D.S., I Azhar E., Madani T.A., Ntoumi F., Kock R., Dar O., Ippolito G., Mchugh T.D., Memish Z.A., Drosten C., Zumla A., Petersen E., The continuing 2019-nCoV epidemic threat of novel coronaviruses to global health - The latest 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China, Int J.

A questionnaire was administered to 721 healthcare workers, with 411 from China and 310 from Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire assessed vocal-related symptoms, perceived voice handicap, frequently heard noise sources, and the quality of communications. The results revealed that the most frequently reported symptoms were ‘voice tiredness’ (20.5 %) and ‘clearing the throat’ (18.3 %). Specifically, 19.4 % of Chinese healthcare workers experienced voice-related symptoms, whereas only 6.3 % of Indonesians reported such symptoms. Longer working hours and working years were significantly associated with voice-related symptoms. Furthermore, the healthcare workers in China and Indonesia both reported mild (<30) voice disorders based on the Voice Handicap Index (VHI-30). Approximately one-fourth (23.8 %) of healthcare workers in China had VHI-30 scores exceeding 30, compared to only 7 % in Indonesia. The differences in vocal-related symptoms and voice handicap between the two countries were significant. Healthcare workers with 50–60 working hours per week exhibited higher scores than those working 40–50 h per week in both countries. Additionally, communication quality and the severity of voice problems for healthcare workers in China were worse than in Indonesia during the pandemic. © 2024 The Author(s)",Face mask; Healthcare workers; Noise; Pandemic; Voice handicap; voice handicap index (VHI),"Vilkman E., Voice problems at work: a challenge for occupational safety and health arrangement, Folia Phoniatr Logop, 52, 1-3, pp. 120-125, (2000); Melnyk P., Jamardo B., Cacace M., Pardo H., Pino A., pp. 1293-1296, (2003); Rosen D.C., Sataloff J.B., Sataloff R.T., Psychology of voice disorders, Plural Publishing, (2020); Bermudez de Alvear R.M., Baron F.J., Martinez-Arquero A.G., School teachers’ vocal use, risk factors, and voice disorder prevalence: guidelines to detect teachers with current voice problems, Folia Phoniatr Logop, 63, 4, pp. 209-215, (2011); Sampaio M.C., dos Reis E.J.F.B., Carvalho F.M., Porto L.A., Araujo T.M., Vocal effort and voice handicap among teachers, J Voice, 26, 6, pp. e15-820, (2012); Lloyd A.T., Gerhard J., Baker P., Lundy D.S., Diaz J., Bretl M.M., Et al., Prevalence of vocal fold pathologies among first-year singing students across genres, Laryngoscope, 130, 8, pp. 1996-2002, (2020); Sobol M., Sielska-Badurek E.M., Osuch-Wojcikiewicz E., Normative values for singing voice handicap index–systematic review and meta-analysis, Braz J Otorhinolaryngol, 86, pp. 497-501, (2020); Fasihat L., Qadeer A., Noor H.S., Khattak S.S., Voice disorders in lawyers; an analytical cross-sectional study in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, J Riphah College Rehabilit Sci, 11, 1, (2023); Merrill R.M., Anderson A.E., Sloan A., Quality of life indicators according to voice disorders and voice-related conditions, Laryngoscope, 121, 9, pp. 2004-2010, (2011); Servilha E.A.M., Leal R.D.O.F., Hidaka M.T.U., Occupational risks in the Brazilian labor legislation: highlight on those related to teacher's health and voice, Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Fonoaudiologia, 15, pp. 505-513, (2010); Verdolini K., Ramig L.O., Occupational risks for voice problems, Logoped Phoniatr Vocol, 26, 1, pp. 37-46, (2001); Busch-Vishniac I.J., West J.E., Barnhill C., Hunter T., Orellana D., Chivukula R., Noise levels in Johns Hopkins hospital, J Acoust Soc Am, 118, 6, pp. 3629-3645, (2005); Darbyshire J.L., Excessive noise in intensive care units, BMJ, 353, (2016); Song Z., Lee P.J., Hampton T., Acoustic environments of intensive care units during the COVID-19 pandemic, Appl Acoust, 199, (2022); Stringer B., Haines T.A., Oudyk J.D., Noisiness in operating theatres: nurses’ perceptions and potential difficulty communicating, J Perioper Pract, 18, 9, pp. 384-391, (2008); Song Z., Lee P.J., Voice use of nurses working in the intensive care unit during the COVID-19 pandemic, Intensive and Critical Care Nursing, 82, (2024); Sala E., Laine A., Simberg S., Pentti J., Suonpaa J., The prevalence of voice disorders among day care center teachers compared with nurses: a questionnaire and clinical study, J Voice, 15, 3, pp. 413-423, (2001); Song Z., Lee P.J., Jung H., Prevalence of voice handicap among nurses in intensive care units due to occupational noise during pandemic, Front Public Health, 11, (2023); Abo-Hasseba A., Waaramaa T., Alku P., Geneid A., Difference in voice problems and noise reports between teachers of public and private schools in upper Egypt, J Voice, 31, 4, pp. e11-508, (2017); Heider C.A., Alvarez M.L., Fuentes-Lopez E., Gonzalez C.A., Leon N.I., Verastegui D.C., Badia P.I., Napolitano C.A., Prevalence of voice disorders in healthcare workers in the universal masking COVID-19 era, The Laryngoscope, 131, 4, pp. E1227-E1233, (2021); Lin Y., Cheng L., Wang Q., Xu W., Effects of medical masks on voice assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic, J Voice, (2021); Helidoni M.E., Murry T., Moschandreas J., Lionis C., Printza A., Velegrakis G.A., Cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the voice handicap index into Greek, J Voice, 24, 2, pp. 221-227, (2010); Franic D.M., Bramlett R.E., Bothe A.C., Psychometric evaluation of disease specific quality of life instruments in voice disorders, J Voice, 19, 2, pp. 300-315, (2005); Hsiung M.-W., Lu P., Kang B.-H., Wang H.-W., Measurement and validation of the voice handicap index in voice-disordered patients in Taiwan, J Laryngol Otol, 117, 6, pp. 478-481, (2003); Lam P.K., Chan K.M., Ho W., Kwong E., Yiu E.M., Wei W.I., Cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the Chinese Voice Handicap Index-10, Laryngoscope, 116, 7, pp. 1192-1198, (2006); Sant'anna S.F.N., de Campos Duprat A., de Andrade M.A., M.F.d.Q.P.

Aim of the study: The study attempted to determine the therapeutic effect of SJD on LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI), as well as to investigate its mechanism of action and assess its therapeutic potential for the cure of inflammation-related diseases in the clinical setting. Materials and methods: We established an ALI model by tracheal drip LPS, and after the administration of SJD, we collected the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissues of mice and examined the expression of inflammatory factors in them. In addition, we evaluated the effects of SJD on the cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase –stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) and inflammasome by immunoblotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Results: We demonstrated that SJD was effective in alleviating LPS-induced ALI by suppressing the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the BALF, improving the level of lung histopathology and the number of neutrophils, as well as decreasing the inflammatory factor-associated gene expression. Importantly, we found that SJD could inhibit multiple stimulus-driven activation of cGAS-STING and inflammasome. Further studies showed that the Chinese herbal medicines in SJD had no influence on the cGAS-STING pathway and inflammasome alone at the formulated dose. By increasing the concentration of these herbs, we observed inhibitory effects on the cGAS-STING pathway and inflammasome, and the effect exerted was maximal when the six herbs were combined, indicating that the synergistic effects among these herbs plays a crucial role in the anti-inflammatory effects of SJD. Conclusions: Our research demonstrated that SJD has a favorable protective effect against ALI, and its mechanism of effect may be associated with the synergistic effect exerted between six Chinese medicines to inhibit the cGAS-STING and inflammasome abnormal activation. These results are favorable for the wide application of SJD in the clinic as well as for the development of drugs for ALI from herbal formulas. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Acute lung injury; cGAS-STING pathway; Inflammasome; Shuangdan Jiedu Decoction; Synergistic effect,"Bai Z., Li P., Wen J., Han Y., Cui Y., Zhou Y., Shi Z., Chen S., Li Q., Zhao X., Wang Z., Li R., Guo Y., Zhan X., Xu G., Ding K., Wang J., Xiao X., Inhibitory effects and mechanisms of the anti-covid-19 traditional Chinese prescription, Keguan-1, on acute lung injury, J.

Central and local government administrators are facing a critical issue of resource utilization efficiency due to their limited resources. This paper employs data envelopment analysis (DEA) and the concept of an assurance region (AR) to assess the relative efficiency of administrative divisions in Taiwan, whose effectiveness has been praised by other countries’ administrators and citizens, regarding COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control. The input factors used were the cumulative number of deaths (an undesirable factor) and expenditures, and the output factors were the average number of unconfirmed citizens aged 65 and older, the average number of unconfirmed citizens aged 0–64, and the cumulative number of vaccinations. Notably, because there are many COVID-19 variants with different characteristics, reaching a consensus AR among experts is difficult. Thus, different ARs were compared, and the most representative AR was identified for subsequent analysis. The main findings show that only Kaohsiung City was efficient, and Taipei City was the third worst due to inefficient operations. In addition, the administrative divisions were classified into four groups using cluster analysis based on the decomposition of aggregate efficiency to the contributions of the three outputs. The findings presented in this paper serve as a reference for both local government administrators and citizens, offering insights into relative efficiency and improvement directions. Moreover, they also provide guidance for resource allocation, future strategy adjustment, and development for central government administrators and citizens worldwide. © 2023 International Federation of Operational Research Societies.",assurance region; cluster analysis; data envelopment analysis; efficiency,"Adabavazeh N., Nikbakht M., Amirteimoori A., Envelopment analysis for global response to novel 2019 coronavirus-SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19), Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management Studies, 7, 2, pp. 1-35, (2020); Ahmad S., Masood S., Khan N.Z., Badruddin I.A., Ahmadian A., Khan Z.A., Khan A.H., Analysing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological health of people using fuzzy MCDM methods, Operations Research Perspectives, 10, (2023); Alekseev G., Amer S., Gopal M., Kuchler T., Schneider J.W., Stroebel J., Wernerfelt N., The effects of COVID-19 on US small businesses: evidence from owners, managers, and employees, Management Science, 69, 1, pp. 7-24, (2023); Atkins J.L., Masoli J.A., Delgado J., Pilling L.C., Kuo C.-L., Kuchel G.A., Melzer D., Tran B.X., Ha G.H., Nguyen L.H., Preexisting comorbidities predicting severe covid-19 in older adults in the UK Biobank community cohort, The Journals of Gerontology: Series A, 75, 11, pp. 2224-2230, (2020); Azadi M., Moghaddas Z., Saen R.F., Gunasekaran A., Mangla S.K., Ishizaka A., Using network data envelopment analysis to assess the sustainability and resilience of healthcare supply chains in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Annals of Operations Research, (2022); Aydin N., Yurdakul G., Assessing countries’ performances against COVID-19 via WSIDEA and machine learning algorithms, Applied Soft Computing, 97, (2020); Baltas K., Jayasekera R., Uddin G.S., Papadopoulos T., The role of resource orchestration in humanitarian operations: a COVID-19 case in the US healthcare, Annals of Operations Research, (2022); Banker R.D., Charnes A., Cooper W.W., Some models for estimating technical and scale inefficiencies in data envelopment analysis, Management Science, 30, 9, pp. 1078-1092, (1984); Bayram G., Yurtsever O., Efficiency evaluation of European countries in terms of Covid-19, International Journal of Advances in Engineering and Pure Sciences, 33, 3, pp. 366-375, (2021); Betthauser B.A., Bach-Mortensen A.M., Engzell P., A systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence on learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, Nature Human Behaviour, 7, 3, pp. 375-385, (2023); The COVID resilience ranking, (2022); Boubaker S., Le T.D., Ngo T., Managing bank performance under COVID-19: a novel inverse DEA efficiency approach, International Transactions in Operational Research, 30, 5, pp. 2436-2452, (2023); Bowlin W.F., Measurin g performance: an introduction to data envelopment analysis (DEA), Journal of Cost Analysis, 7, pp. 3-27, (1998); Financial stability report, (2022); Chang W.C., Lin C.Y., Taiwan's effective pandemic control with dialogic constitutionalism, Routledge Handbook of Law and the COVID-19 Pandemic, pp. 311-323, (2022); Charnes A., Cooper W.W., Rhodes E., Measuring efficiency of decision making units, European Journal of Operational Research, 2, pp. 429-444, (1978); Chen Y., How blockchain adoption affects supply chain sustainability in the fashion industry: a systematic review and case studies, International Transactions in Operational Research, 31, 6, pp. 3592-3620, (2024); Chen S.P., Chang C.W., Measuring the efficiency of university departments: an empirical study using data envelopment analysis and cluster analysis, Scientometrics, 126, 6, pp. 5263-5284, (2021); Chen Y., Zha Y., Wang D., Bi G., Online demand disruption in the presence of constrained capacity, International Transactions in Operational Research, 31, 4, pp. 2591-2612, (2024); Chien L.C., Bey C.K., Koenig K.L., Taiwan's successful COVID-19 mitigation and containment strategy: achieving quasi population immunity, 16, 2, pp. 434-437, (2022); Contardo C., Costa L., On the optimal layout of a dining room in the era of COVID-19 using mathematical optimization, International Transactions in Operational Research, 29, 6, pp. 3294-3315, (2022); Cook W.D., Zhu J., CAR-DEA: context-dependent assurance regions in DEA, Operations Research, 56, 1, pp. 69-78, (2008); Cook W.D., Zhu J., Output-specific input-assurance regions in DEA, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 62, 10, pp. 1881-1887, (2011); Cook W.D., Zhu J., Within-group common weights in DEA: an analysis of power plant efficiency, European Journal of Operational Research, 178, 1, pp. 207-216, (2007); Statistics: Table 3.

We experimentally studied the discharge characteristics of pharmaceutical excipients under vibrational excitation. The successful accurate dosing and filling of powders at fill rates of 0.6–15 mg/s was developed. A simple particle model includes fluid-grain coupling which is relevant to Faraday tilting resulting from gas trapped in the powder bed accurately predicts the discharge rate. A novel continuous micro mixing system was designed based on the discharge model. Any specified proportions can be realized by setting appropriate vibration parameters. The low variability (<2.5 %) in the content of components has verified the reliability of the mixing system. The continuous mixing performance was determined by the discharge characteristics. Yet the particle size distribution and cohesion lead to different mixing performances when the stability of micro feeding is satisfied. Reasonable process parameters for continuous mixing are determined and optimized. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,Cohesive powders; Continuous manufacturing; Continuous mixing; Hopper discharge; Localized vibration,"Besenhard M.O., Faulhammer E., Fathollahi S., Reif G., Calzolari V., Biserni S., Ferrari A., Lawrence S.M., Llusa M., Khinast J.G., Accuracy of micro powder dosing via a vibratory sieve-chute system, Eur.

However, little information is available regarding the frequencies of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation during the post-pandemic period. We aimed to determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation among French university students. Methods: In this comparative study, 4463 students were recruited during the pre-COVID-19 pandemic period (2013-2020) and 1768 students, during the post-COVID-19 pandemic period (2022-2023). Standardized frequencies of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation were compared between the two time periods. Changes in the level of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation between the pre- and post-pandemic periods, were then analyzed using interrupted time series analysis. Results: Compared to participants from the pre-pandemic sample, participants from the post-pandemic sample had higher standardized rates of depressive symptoms (40.6 % vs 25.6 %) and suicidal ideation (29.3 % vs 21.1 %). Segmented logistic regression showed an about 50 % increased risk of depressive symptoms (aOR, 1.47; 95 % CI, 1.01–2.13) and a 100 % increased risk of suicidal ideation (aOR, 2.00; 95 % CI, 1.33–3.00) in the post-pandemic period. Before the pandemic, there was no significant time-trend for depressive symptoms (aOR, 1.002; 95 % CI, 0.999–1.006) and suicidal thoughts (0.999–1.006; aOR, 0.999; 95 % CI, 0.995–1.002). Limitations: Potential biases related to self-selection of participants in the study and information bias. History of depression and suicide attempt were self-reported. Conclusions: These findings reveal an alarming deterioration of students' mental health in the post-pandemic period compared to the pre-pandemic era. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Suicidal ideation; University students,"Aguayo-Estremera R., Canadas G.R., Ortega-Campos E., Pradas-Hernandez L., Martos-Cabrera B., Velando-Soriano A., de la Fuente-Solana E.I., Levels of burnout and engagement after COVID-19 among psychology and nursing students in Spain: a cohort study, Int.

These packages can support infectious disease modelling to be more robust, efficient and transparent, which has been particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed a package for the construction of infectious disease models, integrated it with several open-source libraries and applied this composite pipeline to multiple data sources that provided insights into Australia's 2022 COVID-19 epidemic. We aimed to identify the key processes relevant to COVID-19 transmission dynamics and thereby develop a model that could quantify relevant epidemiological parameters. The pipeline's advantages include markedly increased speed, an expressive application programming interface, the transparency of open-source development, easy access to a broad range of calibration and optimisation tools and consideration of the full workflow from input manipulation through to algorithmic generation of the publication materials. Extending the base model to include mobility effects slightly improved model fit to data, with this approach selected as the model configuration for further epidemiological inference. Under our assumption of widespread immunity against severe outcomes from recent vaccination, incorporating an additional effect of the main vaccination programs rolled out during 2022 on transmission did not further improve model fit. Our simulations suggested that one in every two to six COVID-19 episodes were detected, subsequently emerging Omicron subvariants escaped 30–60% of recently acquired natural immunity and that natural immunity lasted only one to eight months on average. We documented our analyses algorithmically and present our methods in conjunction with interactive online code notebooks and plots. We demonstrate the feasibility of integrating a flexible domain-specific syntax library with state-of-the-art packages in high performance computing, calibration, optimisation and visualisation to create an end-to-end pipeline for infectious disease modelling. We used the resulting platform to demonstrate key epidemiological characteristics of the transition from the emergency to the endemic phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2024 The Authors",Computational simulation; COVID-19; Epidemiology; Software design,"Altarawneh H.N., Chemaitelly H., Ayoub H.H., Hasan M.R., Coyle P., Yassine H.M., Al-Khatib H.A., Smatti M.K., Al-Kanaani Z., Al-Kuwari E., Jeremijenko A., Kaleeckal A.H., Latif A.N., Shaik R.M., Abdul-Rahim H.F., Nasrallah G.K., Al-Kuwari M.G., Butt A.A., Al-Romaihi H.E., Abu-Raddad L.J., Protective effect of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection against omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, New England Journal of Medicine, 387, 17, pp. 1620-1622, (2022); Braeye T., Catteau L., Brondeel R., van Loenhout J.A.F., Proesmans K., Cornelissen L., Van Oyen H., Stouten V., Hubin P., Billuart M., Djiena A., Mahieu R., Hammami N., Van Cauteren D., Wyndham-Thomas C., Vaccine effectiveness against transmission of alpha, delta and omicron SARS-COV-2-infection, Belgian contact tracing, 2021-2022, Vaccine, 41, 20, pp. 3292-3300, (2023); Burgdorf K.S., Simonsen J., Sundby A., Rostgaard K., Pedersen O.B., Sorensen E., Nielsen K.R., Bruun M.T., Frisch M., Edgren G., Erikstrup C., Hjalgrim H., Ullum H., Socio-demographic characteristics of Danish blood donors, PLoS One, 12, 2, (2017); Caldwell J.M., de Lara-Tuprio E., Teng T.R., Estuar M.R.J.E., Sarmiento R.F.R., Abayawardana M., Leong R.N.F., Gray R.T., Wood J.G., Le L.-V., McBryde E.S., Ragonnet R., Trauer J.M., Understanding COVID-19 dynamics and the effects of interventions in the Philippines: A mathematical modelling study, The Lancet Regional Health – Western Pacific, 14, (2021); Carazo S., Skowronski D.M., Brisson M., Barkati S., Sauvageau C., Brousseau N., Gilca R., Fafard J., Talbot D., Ouakki M., Gilca V., Carignan A., Deceuninck G., De Wals P., De Serres G., Protection against omicron (B.1.1.529) BA.2 reinfection conferred by primary omicron BA.1 or pre-omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection among health-care workers with and without mRNA vaccination: A test-negative case-control study, The Lancet Infectious Diseases, 23, 1, pp. 45-55, (2023); Chemaitelly H., Ayoub H.H., Coyle P., Tang P., Yassine H.M., Al-Khatib H.A., Smatti M.K., Hasan M.R., Al-Kanaani Z., Al-Kuwari E., Jeremijenko A., Kaleeckal A.H., Latif A.N., Shaik R.M., Abdul-Rahim H.F., Nasrallah G.K., Al-Kuwari M.G., Butt A.A., Al-Romaihi H.E., Abu-Raddad L.J., Protection of Omicron sub-lineage infection against reinfection with another Omicron sub-lineage, Nature Communications, 13, 1, (2022); Chen C., Nadeau S., Yared M., Voinov P., Xie N., Roemer C., Stadler T., CoV-spectrum: Analysis of globally shared SARS-CoV-2 data to identify and characterize new variants, Bioinformatics, 38, 6, pp. 1735-1737, (2022); COVID-19 Australia: Epidemiology report 58.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of internet-based interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) for symptoms of depression in randomized controlled trial. Methods: Following recruitment via advertisement a total of 113 participants with mild to moderate symptoms of depression were included and randomized to either a ten-week internet-based IPT with weekly therapist guidance or a waitlist control condition. The primary outcome was symptoms of depression measured weekly with the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S) and at pre- and post-treatment assessment with the Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI-II). Secondary outcomes were self-rated quality of life and symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder. We also measured therapeutic alliance and treatment credibility. Outcomes were evaluated with a latent growth curve model (for MADRS-S) and robust linear regression models (for the other measures). The trial was conducted during the Covid-19 pandemic in the spring of 2021. Results: Significant differences favoring the treatment group were found on three of the four outcomes: BDI-II, quality of life ratings, and ratings of generalized anxiety. Between-group effect sizes for these outcomes were moderate (BDI-II, quality of life) or small (generalized anxiety). The latent growth curve model did not indicate a significant difference on the weekly MADRS-S ratings. Exploratory analyses did not show an association between therapeutic alliance, treatment credibility and outcome. Limitations: Missing data at post-treatment was high in the treatment group (37 %), though the missingness was not significantly related to observed ratings at pre-treatment or estimated trajectories during the treatment. Few participants completed all modules. The Covid-19 pandemic situation may have affected both effects and dropout rates. Conclusions: Internet-based IPT can lead to significant improvements, though the reductions in symptoms of depression were not consistent across the two measures used. Completion rates and dropout patterns suggest a need for improved acceptability. Trial registration: The trial was preregistered at Clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04721678).

As a safeguard against worsening contamination, combining geothermal energy with an All-Air Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning system (HVAC) with 100 % fresh air intake is also crucial in the context of the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, this study suggests using geothermal energy as a backup source to run a typical All-Air centralized HVAC system. The resulting system is referred to as a combined system from now on, and its primary goals are to lower the amount of operating energy needed while being environmentally and financially sound. In this context, the creative way of combining the suggested geothermal duct with the All-Air HVAC system possesses various insights, as demonstrated by the thorough thermal analysis and related design. Strong conclusions were derived from a thorough case study focused on Lebanon: adding 100 % fresh air intake leads to an astounding yearly energy savings of 67 %, whereas configurations with 10 % and 30 % fresh air produced energy savings of 52 % and 36 %, respectively. In the study, a geothermal multi-duct system was also suggested and looked at. The research revealed that the 311-m length of the single geothermal duct connected to a pressure of 7000 Pa was reduced to 210 m and the pressure drop was lowered to 140 Pa when a geothermal multi-duct system was employed. Furthermore, as the computed payback period makes clear, the integrated system presents an appealing chance to drastically cut resource usage during energy consumption, lower CO2 emissions, and provide 100 % fresh air circulation. © 2024 The Authors",All-air HVAC system; Case study; Economic insights; Geothermal energy; Thermal modeling,"Moghadam M., Ghaffarzadeh N., Suppressing solar PV output fluctuations by designing an efficient hybrid energy storage system controller, Unconventional Resources, 4, (2024); Ma Y., Li Y., Gan Q., Zhi S., Numerical investigation of energy dissipation when shear wave passing through interface in rock mass, Unconventional Resources, 3, pp. 142-154, (2023); Liu J., Liu Q., Xu H., Ding Q., Zhu D., Meng Q., Genesis and energy significance of natural hydrogen, Unconventional Resources, 3, pp. 176-182, (2023); Taher R., Ahmed M.M., Haddad Z., Abid C., Poiseuille-Rayleigh-Bénard mixed convection flow in a channel: heat transfer and fluid flow patterns, Int.

From business to healthcare, the revolutions of predictive analytics studies are constantly evolving to help decision makers identify the problem and make a wise decision. While a bigger impact has been reported on the development of predictive models in business studies, there has been very little effort that investigates the deployment of predictive models by using machine learning approaches specifically involving SMEs. Small business entrepreneurs (SMEs) are among the entities most affected because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, this study aims to develop a model that could predict the motivation score of GKP recipients based on three factors: satisfaction, perceived value, and perceived expectation. Four different regression models, namely Linear, Ridge, Lasso, and SVR, were developed and evaluated as the best model by using Rapid Miner machine learning software tools. The GKIPP grant dataset has been used as a case study for estimating the motive of the GKP grant to evaluate the outcomes of various regression models. The findings indicate that linear and SVR models have produced highly accurate predictions about the motivation of GKP recipients. They have also produced a high proportion of R-square scores across all regression models, which is highly encouraging. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

In developed countries, government pressure to reduce healthcare spending and the COVID-19 pandemic have led to the spread of home-based care. This type of care is proven to outperform the center-based one in terms of cost-effectiveness, patient satisfaction, and adherence to treatment guidelines. However, even for treatments usually suitable to be delivered at home, the patient's health status or other constraints may make it inappropriate to deliver service at the patient's home. This calls for a new organizational model, referred to as flexible care, where home-based and center-based care are not seen as mutually exclusive models but as options that can be activated according to the patient's and provider's needs. This paper presents a novel network-based deterministic optimization model and two matheuristics to address a scheduling problem typically faced by providers adopting a flexible care model. The model considers a provider relying on a treatment room with a fixed number of medical chairs, a fleet of vehicles, and a team of operators. It allows for determining on which days of the planning horizon, in which setting (home or center), and by which operator each patient will be treated. The model takes into account patients’ preferences and considers two objective functions: minimizing provider costs and patients’ travel time. In addition, we propose a two-stage mixed-integer stochastic programming model with recourse actions. This model allows incorporating the uncertainty due to the occurrence of adverse events. Adverse events are sudden changes in the patient's condition randomly happening at a specific point in the planning horizon. These events render the patient unsuitable for home care and require them to be visited at the center from that moment onward. The models have been inspired by a real case and tested on multiple random instances. © 2024 The Author(s)",Flexible care; Health care; Home care; Matheuristics; Network optimization; Stochastic programming,"Chaieb M., Jemai J., Mellouli K., A decomposition-construction approach for solving the home health care scheduling problem, Health Care Manag.

To achieve this, a quantitative research design was used, and a total of 500 students (101 boys and 399 girls) in Indonesia were selected as respondents using proportional random sampling techniques. Data collection was carried out using a learning motivation scale questionnaire. The results showed that students had a high level of motivation, with an average score of 50.8. The desire to work can be seen from hopes and dreams, as well as a conducive environment. It is known that external factors such as encouragement from others and involvement in activities have a greater influence with significance scores of 0.801 and 0.766 respectively. Meanwhile, appreciation and hopes or aspirations each received a score of 0.709 and 0.704. This implies that encouragement and activity can be integrated into the student's self. The research also shows that gender does not have a significant effect on the desire to learn. However, providing appropriate encouragement and rewards will increase students' willingness to learn, which can be maintained by educational institutions and parents and instill a desire for personal progress and development. © 2025, Intelektual Pustaka Media Utama.

The outbreak of the disease has affected the world in a negative manner. The development and on-going vaccination efforts has reduced the mortality rate in people with existing comorbidities and lowered virus transmission rate. However, there are still the needs for prescribed medicines that can be consumed by COVID-19 infected persons. Momordica charantia L. has been used in traditional medicines to treat various diseases including anti-diabetic and cancer. Pharmacological studies on Momordica charantia L. revealed that the plant stored many useful phytoconstituents that might be exploited for producing drug compounds to treat COVID-19. Nowadays, computational-aided drug methods are widely used in drug discovery process as it requires minimal compound design and improve the development pipeline. In this study, molecular docking of five phytochemicals from Momordica charantia L. were carried out against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). The results obtained revealed that some of the phytochemicals showed a better dock score compared to the drug molnupiravir. Based on the dock score and the medicinal properties of each compound, it is suggested that these compounds can be further studied for potential drugs against COVID-19. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

Teachers should be the key to solving problems. This research aims to measure how much influence the competence of professional elementary school teachers has on student engagement in Indonesia. This research uses a quantitative approach with a correlational design and survey method. Data collection was carried out through teacher professional competency and student involvement questionnaires, with data sources coming from elementary school teachers and students in the western, eastern, and central regions of Indonesia. Samples were taken using the cluster random sampling technique. Quantitative data analysis was used with descriptive statistical stages, correlation analysis, regression analysis, and comparative analysis. The results of the hypothesis test also show that professional competence in the aspect of understanding content and understanding the curriculum has a significant influence on student engagement, while in the aspect of understanding student character, it does not have a significant influence. These results make an important contribution to teachers' ongoing professional development. Aspects of content development and curriculum development are recommended as priorities for self-development. © 2025, Intelektual Pustaka Media Utama.

Grounded on the paradigm that creativity is a tangible parameter, this study aims to explore students’ creative thinking skill via a reading-based creativity test. The test was developed by considering the creativity indicators defined by Paul Torrance, i.e., fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration. In this creativity test, the reading and the questions were designed to make students integrate their science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) knowledge. Based on the empirical validation, the creativity test had a reliability of 0.897, indicating that the test was reliable to measure students’ creativity. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the test was conducted online to 108 junior high school students in East Java, Indonesia. In general, the students achieved the highest level of creativity in terms of originality that gained average score of 3.63 (with scale 4.00). Meanwhile, they underperformed on the aspects of elaboration having average score of 2.40. There were 93 and 79 students who responded very well on the originality and fluency aspects, respectively. In contrast, respectively over 30% and 50% of students showed a lack of creativity on the aspect of flexibility and elaboration. These creativity assessment data are beneficial for educational stakeholders especially to increase the quality of teaching and learning related to STEAM education. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

Feelings of disconnection and alienation interfere with learning and affect individual well-being. Although many students have physically returned to classrooms, it remains clear that online education, which predates the pandemic and expanded massively in 2020, is here to stay. This article attempts to answer the question, “how can education be ‘rooted’ in place when place itself is increasingly ephemeral, non-existent, or untethered to a geolocation?” This call to (teaching) action presents an argument for using place-based pedagogy adapted for the digital context to promote student connectedness, well-being, and engagement with curricular materials and describes strategies to incorporate place-based pedagogy-inspired materials and assignments in online classes across the curriculum. The practices described in this article can foster a place-based educational approach that supports learners’ connections to place and growth as citizens and scholars. © 2025 Common Ground Research Networks.

The main protease (Mpro) is critical for SARS-CoV-2 replication and acts as an effective target for drug development. To date, many flavonoid compounds have been reported to exhibit inhibition of Mpro, and flavonoid structures are informative for the development of new inhibitors. In the present study, we first evaluated the ability of 35 flavonoid compounds to bind Mpro and found that the hydrophobic interaction generated between the benzene ring and the residues may be the main source of binding force. The in vitro inhibitory activity of these compounds was tested by the FRET method, and most of them showed significant inhibition of Mpro. Preliminary analysis revealed that the presence of the glycosidic group was detrimental to the activity of the compounds, in addition the position of the hydroxyl substituent had an effect on the activity of the compounds. Reliable and predictive CoMFA (q2 = 0.541, r2 = 0.998, SEE = 0.039) and CoMISA (q2 = 0.554, r2 = 0.999, SEE = 0.034) models were developed, and the compounds were analyzed by 3D-QSAR with modeled steric, electrostatic, hydrogen bond donor, and hydrophobic fields. A series of compounds were synthesized and characterized, which showed similar experimental and predicted activities, with the activity of 15d (IC50 = 0.74 ± 0.04 uM) exceeding that of the template molecule 15 (0.98 ± 0.13 uM). Subsequently, molecular docking revealed the binding mode of 15d to Mpro and verified the predictions of steric, hydrogen bond donor, and hydrophobic field. In conclusion, these findings provide ideas for subsequent structural studies of flavonoids that could be used in the development of flavonoid-type SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. © 2024",3D-QSAR; COVID-19; Flavonoid; SARS-CoV-2 main protease,"Wu F., Zhao S., Yu B., Et al., A new coronavirus associated with human respiratory disease in China, Nature, 579, pp. 265-269, (2020); Stein S.R., Ramelli S.C., Grazioli A., Et al., SARS-CoV-2 infection and persistence in the human body and brain at autopsy, Nature, 612, pp. 758-763, (2022); Lewnard J.A., Vennis H., Et al., Association of SARS-CoV-2 BA.4/BA.5 Omicron lineages with immune escape and clinical outcome, Nat.

Leveraging the framework developed by Angstmann [1], our approach incorporates fractional derivatives to best describe the nuanced dynamics of the vaccination process. We begin by examining the qualitative properties of the proposed model. To substantiate the inclusion of fractional derivatives, empirical data along with statistical criteria are applied. Numerical simulations are performed to compare both integer and fractional order models. An epidemiological interpretation for the fractional order of the model is provided, in the context of a vaccination campaign. © 2024 The Author(s)",COVID-19; Fractional derivatives; SIR model; Vaccine hesitancy,"Angstmann C.N., Henry B.I., McGann A.V., A fractional-order infectivity and recovery sir model, Fractal Fract., 1, 1, (2017); Dokoumetzidis A., Macheras P., Fractional kinetics in drug absorption and disposition processes, J.

The world lacked the means and methods for early detection of this virus. Several traditional methods were used for detecting the virus, such as thermometers, remote thermal detection guns, and other conventional methods. Most of these systems monopolized making profits or selling their camera products, with prices for these cameras equipped with temperature detection systems exceeding three thousand dollars. An unsupervised model for real-time detection of thermal face skin temperature is proposed. Despite the scarcity and limited availability of thermal video data, we found and used a database created at Nazarbayev University in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan, which contains clips of thermal video and RGB video. The two different videos were calibrated, and the unity was measured by two metrics: SSIM and correlation. Four methods of registration were used to achieve perfect congruence, and congruence was also measured through the two previous metrics. The K-means method was then used to extract clusters, and functions for post-processing were built. The thermal face skin was extracted by multiplying the binary face mask with the thermal face, and the temperature of the face was calculated by taking the average values of the thermal face skin pixels and converting them from Fahrenheit to Celsius. Satisfactory results were obtained, with some temperatures detected within the normal range, others below the normal range, and others higher than this rate. © 2025 Malque Publishing.

Among the employed acoustic features, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are widely used for automatic analysis, with MFCC extraction commonly relying on default parameters. However, no comprehensive study has systematically investigated the impact of MFCC extraction parameters on respiratory disease diagnosis. In this study, we address this gap by examining the effects of key parameters, namely the number of coefficients, frame length, and hop length between frames, on respiratory condition examination. Our investigation uses four datasets: the Cambridge COVID-19 Sound database, the Coswara dataset, the Saarbrücken Voice Disorders (SVD) database, and a TACTICAS dataset. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed as the classifier, given its widespread adoption and efficacy. Our findings indicate that the accuracy of MFCC decreases as hop length increases, and the optimal number of coefficients is observed to be approximately 30. The performance of MFCC varies with frame length across the datasets: for the COVID-19 datasets (Cambridge COVID-19 Sound database and Coswara dataset), performance declines with longer frame lengths, while for the SVD dataset, performance improves with increasing frame length (from 50 ms to 500 ms). Furthermore, we investigate the optimized combination of these parameters and observe substantial enhancements in accuracy. Compared to the worst combination, the SVM model achieves an accuracy of 81.1%, 80.6%, and 71.7%, with improvements of 19.6%, 16.10%, and 14.90% for the Cambridge COVID-19 Sound database, the Coswara dataset, and the SVD dataset respectively. To validate the generalization of these findings, we employ the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model as a validation model. Remarkably, the LSTM model also demonstrates improved accuracy of 14.12%, 10.10%, and 6.68% across the datasets when utilizing the optimal combination of parameters. The optimal parameters are validated using an external voice pathology dataset (TACTICAS dataset). The results demonstrate the generalization capabilities of the optimized parameters across various pathologies, machine-learning models, and languages. © 2024 The Author(s)",Acoustic biomarkers; MFCC extraction parameters;

Methods: The Japanese government declared a state of emergency in April 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 309 patients who underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for acute cholangitis caused by choledocholithiasis between April 2017 and December 2022. Results: Patients were categorized into a pregroup (n = 134) and a postgroup (n = 175), depending on whether they were diagnosed before or after the state of emergency declaration. The total number of ERCP cases and the number of ERCP cases with endoscopic stone removals increased after the state of emergency declaration. Compared with the pregroup, the numbers of patients with performance status of 0–1 and surgically altered anatomy increased, whereas the numbers of patients taking oral antiplatelets or anticoagulants and those with cerebrovascular disease decreased in the postgroup. The number of single-stage endoscopic stone removals increased and hospital stays were significantly shorter in the postgroup. No differences in adverse event rates were detected between the two groups. Conclusions: Although our hospital provides tertiary care, the number of patients with cholangitis in good general condition and no underlying disease increased after the state of emergency declaration. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an increase in the number of single-stage endoscopic treatments and shortened hospital stays for patients with acute cholangitis caused by choledocholithiasis. No safety issues with ERCP were detected, even during the pandemic. © 2024 The Authors.

The closing price of each stock is used as the basis for calculating the cross-correlation between the companies' returns. Minimum spanning trees are employed to analyse the relationships and visualize the correlation changes for each period. Additionally, degree centrality is utilized to analyse the network's structure further. This study covers the period from 2020 to 2021 and involves 39 companies within the technology sector. The findings reveal significant fluctuations in the companies' correlations each year. Moreover, the most influential companies vary according to the period, demonstrating position changes. The fact that Inari Amertron (INAR), Revenue Group (REVE), and My EG Services (MYEG) consistently become leading players in different years shows how strong and influential they are in the technology sector. This suggests that these companies have the ability to shape market trends and possibly even control the direction of the industry. The results provide valuable insights for investors and policymakers, aiding in visualizing company relationships and facilitating strategic portfolio optimization. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

We firstly study the existence and uniqueness of the globally positive solution to the stochastic SIRI model with positive initial value. Then we obtain sufficient conditions for the extinction of the disease in the stochastic epidemic model, and find that the large noise can make the disease die out exponentially. Meanwhile, we obtain that the solution to the stochastic model has a unique stationary distribution when R0s˜ is greater than one. Our results show that the intensity of white noise can affect the dynamical behaviors of the model. Finally, we use numerical simulation to illustrate theoretical results, and apply both the stochastic and deterministic models to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic in Serbia. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Generalized nonlinear incidence; SIRI model; Stationary distribution,"Berrhazi B., El Fatini M., Caraballo Garrido T., Et al., A stochastic SIRI epidemic model with Lévy noise, Discrete Contin.

The days of traditional antibiotics are over since their overuse has led to worldwide health and environmental issues. Thus, there is a need for novel antimicrobial proteins/peptides with improved properties over existing ones. The goal of microbiology research over the past ten years has been to identify, create, and market antimicrobials from benign microorganisms that are just as effective. The bioactive peptides or proteins, synthesized by probiotics and other beneficial microorganisms, are also referred to as postbiotics. The application of the recently created postbiotics is unrestricted in the food sector. Nisin and pediocin are two postbiotics that are widely used in the worldwide food sector. If successful, they could also be the best candidates to be therapeutic proteins that take the place of traditional antibiotics. Scope and approach: To gain a comprehensive understanding of today's postbiotic landscape, it's crucial to grasp the importance of bacteriocin and its diverse applications across various sectors such as food, heterologous expression, bioprocessing, and as a substitute for antibiotics. Key findings and conclusions: Peptides with antibacterial properties that are authorized for use in the food industry are known as bacteriocins. They are utilized in agriculture, the food industry, and other fields. Due to new restrictions, stronger antiviral treatments are among the novel antimicrobial drugs being researched. The potential application of bacteriocins in COVID-19 therapy is under investigation. Additionally, other alternatives such as plant-based chemicals, animal venoms, and bacteriophage therapy have also contributed to the development of antibiotic substitutes. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Antimicrobials;

Understanding the factors influencing purchase intention in an online shopping context is crucial for businesses to optimize the customer experience and increase sales. Besides, the impact of the changes that will be made by the online business based on the study result will hopefully make it easier for users to make purchasing decisions and enjoy using online services without feeling insecure about various scam activities. Therefore, this study aims to identify the factors that drive consumers' purchase intentions for online shopping in Malaysia. Using a voluntary sampling technique in the survey approach, a total of 158 respondents' data in Malaysia were selected and analyzed using multiple linear regression. Four factors were chosen in relation to purchase intention which are price, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and social media. The output revealed that price, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and social media have a positive significant effect on consumers’ purchase intention. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

Changes over time can affect the demographic characteristics of the blood donor population. Voluntary donors tend to be safer than replacement donors in terms of TTIs transmission risks. This study aims to analyze the characteristics of voluntary and replacement blood donors in Dr. Sardjito Hospital Blood Center. This retrospective study analyzed the data of whole blood donors from January 2017 to May 2020. The number of donations was calculated as cumulative number based on the donor data bases. Data were presented as median (minimum-maximum) and proportion. Analysis was conducted using the Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests. There were 54,152 blood donors during the study period, consisted of 47,525 (87.8%) voluntary donors and 6,627 (12.2%) replacement donors. Most of the donors were male, with higher proportion in replacement donors (p <0.001). Voluntary donors tended to be younger than replacement ones [30(17-77) years and 35(17-70) years, respectively] (p <0.001). Voluntary donors gave blood more frequently (p <0.001). The proportion of donation number in two groups showed significantly different (p <0.001). The most donated blood types were O, D positive. There was an increasing trend in the monthly number of bloods donated from 2017 to 2019, but a decreasing trend in 2020. The decrease of blood donation during 2020, may be related to COVID-19 pandemic. © 2025 by SPC.",Blood donors; donor demography; replacement donors; voluntary donors,"Ghaffari Y.D., Ghorbanian N., Modern blood banking & transfusion practices, Eurasian Journal of Science and Technology, 3, (2018);

Most studies used large-scale, aggregated data, with limited adjustment for individual factors, most of them focused on viral spread than severe outcomes. Moreover, evidence simultaneously evaluating variables belonging to different exposure domains is scarce, and none analysing their collective impact on an individual level. Methods: Our population-based retrospective cohort study aimed to assess the comprehensive role played by exposure variables belonging to four different domains, environmental, climatic, socio-economic, and non-pharmacological interventions (NPI), on individual COVID-19-related risk of hospitalization and death, analysing data from all patients (no. 68472) tested positive to a SARS-CoV-2 swab in Modena Province (Northern Italy) between February 2020 and August 2021. Using adjusted Cox proportional hazard models, we estimated the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, investigating dose-response relationships through restricted cubic spline modelling for hazard ratios. Results: Several significant associations emerged: long-term exposure to air pollutants (NO2, PM10, PM2.5) was linked to hospitalization risk in a complex way and showed an increased risk for death; while humidity was inversely associated; temperature showed a U-shaped risk; wind speed showed a linear association with both outcomes. Precipitation increased hospitalization risk but decreased mortality. Socio-economic and NPI indices showed clear linear associations, respectively negative and positive, with both outcomes. Conclusions: Our findings offer insights for evidence-based policy decisions, improving precision healthcare practices, and safeguarding public health in future pandemics. Refinement of pandemic response plans by healthcare authorities could benefit significantly. © 2024 The Author(s)",Containment and health index; COVID-19 outcomes; Deprivation index; Environmental and climate factors; Italy; Restrictive measures,"Antolini G., Auteri L., Pavan V., Tomei F., Tomozeiu R., Marletto V., A daily high-resolution gridded climatic data set for Emilia-Romagna, Italy, during 1961-2010: emilia-romagna daily gridded climatic data set, Int.

Design: Based on the K-means clustering algorithm, a comprehensive analysis of survey data identifies distinct consumer clusters based on their adaptive capacities, resilience, and shopping preferences. The study encompasses a broad demographic spectrum, examining various aspects such as age, urban or rural residence, education, household size, and income. Findings: The findings identify several clusters of consumers showing specific behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic and their subsequent shopping behaviours, unveiling distinct profiles of adaptation, resilience, and shopping preferences. The K-means clustering algorithm allows the identification of four distinct consumer clusters. Implications: The results have significant implications for understanding consumer behaviour, tailoring marketing strategies, and shaping the future of retail under the New Normal. Each cluster's characteristics provide valuable insights for businesses to align strategies with evolving consumer needs, considering both demographic factors and shopping preferences. Originality: The research contributes to the understanding of consumer behaviour during times of crisis, providing relevant insights from a theoretical perspective based on the K-means clustering algorithm. © 2024 The Authors",Adaptation; Clusters; Consumer behavior; COVID-19; Pandemic impact; Resilience; Shopping preferences,"Agrawal D.K., Gupta S., A new theoretical framework of shopping motives and channel preference behaviour in the digital era, Int.

Nine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (4- to 6-ring PAHs) were determined in fine and coarse particles. The gas/particle partitioning coefficients (Kp) of the PAHs were calculated from the supercooled liquid vapour pressure and octanol-air partitioning coefficient based on the relationships obtained in previous traffic pollution-related studies. Gaseous PAHs were estimated by Kp and the concentrations of PM and particulate PAHs. The concentrations of total PAHs were 32.5, 320.1 and 5646.2 pg/m3 in the PM>2.5, PM2.5 and gas phases, respectively. Significant seasonal trends in PAHs were observed (particle phase: lowest in summer, gas phase: lowest in spring, particle and gas phase: lowest in spring). Compared to 2019, the total PAH concentrations (in particles) decreased in 2020, especially in spring and summer, which might be due to reduced traffic trips during the COVID-19 outbreak. The incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) calculated from the toxic equivalent concentrations relative to benzo[a]pyrene (BaPeq) was lower than the acceptable limit issued by the US Environmental Protection Agency, indicating a low cancer risk in long-term exposure to current PAH levels. It is notable that gaseous PAHs considerably contributed to BaPeq and ILCR (over 50%), which highlighted the significance of gaseous PAH monitoring for public health protection. This low-cost estimation method for gaseous PAHs can be expected to reliably and conveniently obtain PAH concentrations as a surrogate for traditional sampling in the future work. © 2023",COVID-19; Exposure-response relationship; Gas-particle partitioning; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Traffic,"Abdel-Shafy H.I., Mansour M.S.M., A review on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons: source, environmental impact, effect on human health and remediation, Egypt.

In this concern, Favipiravir (FAV) has attracted considerable attention as an effective antiviral drug against this disease. In this study, the favipiravir's derivative (3‑hydroxy-6-methoxypyrazine-2-carboxamide) was synthetized, in presence of iron (III), and fully characterized through various analytical techniques including single-XRay, IR, UV and 1H/13C NMR. The refinement show the exclusive existence of enol form in the solid state. In solution, UV and NMR data were used to highlight the tautomeric equilibrium of this molecule. Additionally, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations were achieved to estimate the chemical parameters, electronic affinity and molecular electrostatic potential of the compound. Mulliken atomic charges as well as the chemical reactivity descriptors were investigated. Finally, the two tautomer forms of synthetized derivative were docked on SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB: 6LU7) and spike receptor-binding domain (PDB: 7BZ5) to evaluate their binding affinity. The docking simulation studies was predicted that the two forms had high binding affinity the critical amino acids residues of the receptor. This affinity was attributed to the presence of several hydrogen bonds for both tautomer along with five different hydrophobic interactions with the enol form. These results conduct to conclude that the synthetized product could be an interest potential drug for that type of diseases. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",COVID-19; Favipiravir derivative; Lewis acid; Molecular docking; Single XRay,"Estimating excess mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic analysis of COVID-19-related mortality, 2020-21, Lancet, 399, pp. 1513-1536, (2022); Qomara W.F., Primanissa D.N., Amalia S.H., Purwadi F.V., Zakiyah N., Effectiveness of Remdesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, and Favipiravir for COVID-19 treatment: a systematic review, Int.

This paper offers a comprehensive evaluation of different adsorbents, including 13X, LiLSX, 5A, CaX, Ag-ETS-10, and AgLiLSX, utilized in MOCs. Process modeling and multi-objective optimization are conducted to assess the effectiveness of these adsorbents using the Skarstrøm cycle, employing pressure swing adsorption (PSA), vacuum swing adsorption (VSA), and pressure vacuum swing adsorption (PVSA) processes. The optimization result indicates that LiLSX is the top choice, providing medical-grade oxygen at a total product flow rate exceeding 15 SLPM. Additionally, 13X and CaX are identified as economical alternatives, particularly suitable for employment in the PSA and VSA processes, respectively. This study highlights the significance of establishing a connection between the Medical and Chemical Engineering communities through the direct incorporation of medical performance indicators, such as the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2), into the optimization process. The findings serve as a guide for selecting an appropriate design based on the patient's requirements and demonstrate LiLSX's capability to meet a diverse range of treatments, achieving FIO2 values up to 0.75. Furthermore, we explore the flexibility of MOC designs in meeting the demands of multiple patients simultaneously and propose energy-efficient design options based on patient needs. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into optimizing MOCs, ensuring effective and reliable oxygen therapy for patients, while also addressing challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic and potential global lithium scarcity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Material screening; Medical oxygen concentrator; Pressure swing adsorption; Process optimization,"World Health Organization, Technical Specifications for Oxygen Concentrators: WHO Medical Device Technical Series, (2016); Ackley M.W., Medical oxygen concentrators: a review of progress in air separation technology, Adsorption, 25, 8, pp. 1437-1474, (2019); Jindal S., Oxygen therapy: important considerations, Indian J.

We have witnessed worldwide disasters during the COVID-19 pandemic because of infectious viruses, and these incidents often unfold in various phases and waves. During this pandemic, so many deaths have occurred worldwide that they cannot even be counted accurately. The biggest issue that comes to the forefront is that health workers going to treat patients suffering from COVID-19 also may get infected. Many health workers have lost their lives to COVID-19 and are still losing their lives. The situation can worsen further by coinciding with other natural disasters like cyclones, earthquakes, and tsunamis. In these situations, an intelligent automated model is needed to provide contactless medical services such as ambulance facilities and primary health tests. In this paper, we explore these types of services safely with the help of an intelligent automated transportation model using a vehicular delay-tolerant network. To solve the scenario, we propose an intelligent transportation system for automated medical services to prevent healthcare workers from becoming infected during testing and collecting health data by collaborating with a delay-tolerant network of vehicles in intelligent transport systems. The proposed model automatically categorizes and filters infected patients, providing medical facilities based on their illnesses. Our mathematical evaluation and simulation results affirm the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed model, highlighting its strength compared to existing state-of-the-art protocols. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Automation; Intelligent transportation system (ITS); Machine learning; Opportunistic network; Routing protocol; Smart medical service; Vehicular delay tolerant networks (VDTN),"Allam Z., Jones D.S., On the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and the smart city network: universal data sharing standards coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) to benefit urban health monitoring and management, Healthcare, 8, (2020); Mishra A.K., Vanganuru N., Monitoring a tropical super cyclone Amphan over Bay of Bengal and nearby region in May 2020, Remote Sens.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, UCC applications, such as Microsoft Team, Zoom Meeting, and Google Meet played major roles to support the teaching and learning process. However, the acceptance of UCC applications and their impacts on the future of teaching and learning process, especially for university students in rural areas, are concerned. Based on this, the current study aims to examine the factors that influence the acceptance of UCC applications at the University in Sumbawa Island, Indonesia using adapted theories of Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model (UTAUT). In light, survey questionnaire was distributed online to 210 undergraduate students at the University in Sumbawa Island, Indonesia, to test seven factors, Facilitating Condition (FC), Performance Expectancy (PE), Effort Expectancy (EE), Social Influence (SI), Motivation (MO), Collaboration (CO), and Behavioural Intention (BI) which were analysed using SPSS software. The findings reveal that PE, EE, SI, FC, MO, CO, and BI are significant factors that influence the acceptance of UCC applications. This finding will be a sound reference to improve the use of UCC applications for teaching and learning as well as help universities strategies their future teaching and learning system. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

Some experts recommend 6 mL/kg of predicted body weight (PBW) for all patients, while others suggest 7–9 mL/kg PBW for those with compliance >50 mL/cmH2O. We investigated whether a tidal volume ≥ 7 ml/kg PBW may be safe in COVID-19 patients, particularly those with compliance >50 mL/cmH2O. Materials and methods: This secondary analysis of a multicenter study compares the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality among 600 patients ventilated with <7 or ≥ 7 mL/kg PBW. Compliance was categorized as <40, 40–50, or > 50 mL/cmH2O. Results: 346 patients were ventilated with <7 (6.2 ± 0.5) mL/kg PBW and 254 with ≥7 (7.9 ± 0.9) mL/kg PBW. ICU mortality was 33 % and 29 % in the two groups (p = 0.272). At multivariable regression analysis, tidal volume ≥ 7 mL/kg PBW was associated with lower ICU mortality in the overall population (odds ratio: 0.62 [95 %-confidence interval: 0.40–0.95]) and in each compliance category. Conclusions: A tidal volume ≥ 7 (up to 9) mL/kg PBW was associated with lower ICU mortality in these COVID-19 patients, including those with compliance <40 mL/cmH2O. This finding should be interpreted cautiously due to the retrospective study design.

We analyze the model for stability, and the results demonstrate the system's stable behavior under specific conditions, suggesting the possibility of effective control. The model is subjected to sensitivity analysis, revealing the most influential parameters affecting the infestation's dynamics. These parameters are identified as key targets for intervention. The optimal control strategy is derived using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, minimizing the cost of intervention while effectively controlling the infestation. The results demonstrate the importance of early intervention and sustained control efforts. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of scabies infestation dynamics, highlighting the critical factors influencing its spread and the most effective control strategies. The findings inform public health policy and guide resource allocation to combat scabies infestations effectively. The major contributions include improved understanding of scabies transmission dynamics, identification of critical parameters, development of evidence-based control strategies, evaluation of resource allocation effectiveness, and assessing intervention impact. It may also contribute to public health policy, resource allocation, disease surveillance, and intervention strategies. Numerical simulations are carried out to support our analytical findings. © 2024 The Authors",Linearization theory; Lyapunov function; Mathematical model; Scabies control and numerical simulations; Scabies infestation; Sensitivity analysis; Stability analysis,"Romani L., Steer A.C., Whitfeld M.J., Kaldor J.M., Prevalence of scabies and impetigo worldwide: A systematic review, Lancet Infect.

Although mortality and morbidity effects have been disproportionately felt among older generations, there is growing recognition that adolescents have also faced multidimensional consequences, fueled by closure of schools and recreational spaces, and widespread disruption to services. While much has been written about the educational and health effects of the pandemic on adolescents, less attention has been given to other aspects of their wellbeing. This narrative review therefore summarizes the current evidence on the effects of the pandemic on adolescent wellbeing. We draw on the United Nations (UN) H6 + Technical Working Group on Adolescent Health and Well-being's conceptualization of adolescent wellbeing (Ross et al., 2020), focusing on three domains: connectedness, positive values and contribution to society; safety and a supportive environment; and agency and resilience. Drawing on both peer-reviewed and grey literature from high-, middle- and low-income contexts, we focused our search on adolescents (aged 10–19) and Covid-19 pandemic-related effects on wellbeing in these three domains. We also highlight findings related to three groups of adolescents who have often been overlooked in the literature on the impact of the pandemic: adolescent refugees, married adolescents, and adolescents with disabilities. We searched using Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus, as well as working paper series at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) and the World Bank, to identify published and grey literature across the three domains of interest. We restricted the search to articles that presented new, original data, included adolescents (aged 10–19), and were published in English, between January 1, 2020 and April 30, 2022. We expanded the search to make use of the bibliographies uncovered through this review to check for other citations that might meet the search criteria. The search yielded 193 articles on adolescent wellbeing in the three domains of interest during the Covid–19 pandemic. Adolescents in high-income countries (HICs) were overrepresented compared to those in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (126 vs. 60 articles). Furthermore, more articles focused on social connectedness (117 studies) than on adolescent wellbeing in terms of agency and resilience (73 studies) and safety and a supportive environment (61 studies). Nearly three years after the Covid-19 pandemic's onset, the literature on adolescent wellbeing highlights the multiple and intersecting challenges that adolescents faced, especially those living in LMICs. Service disruptions (notably school closures) combined with financial stress, heightened vulnerability to age- and gender-based violence, and social isolation placed unprecedented pressures on young people, taking a toll on their physical and mental health. Evidence that the pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities – with the most vulnerable adolescents (such as refugees, adolescents with disabilities and married girls) seemingly worst affected – is particularly salient for policy makers. While many adolescents are finding ways to cope (by relying on family and teacher support, connecting with peers through online networks or volunteering), understanding how to promote adolescent resilience more effectively – particularly in LMIC contexts – will be essential to ensure a rapid post-Covid-19 recovery. © 2024",Adolescence; Agency; Covid-19; Resilience; Safety; Social-emotional development,"(2021); Alvis L.M., Douglas R.D., Shook N.J., Oosterhoff B., Associations between adolescents’ prosocial experiences and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, Current Psychology, (2022); Antoniou A.-S., Palivakou E., Polychroni F., Resilience in children and adolescents during the Covid-19 pandemic, Developmental and Adolescent Health, 1, 4, pp. 34-41, (2021); Bai Y., Liu X., Zhang B., Fu M., Huang N., Hu Q., Guo J., Associations of youth mental health, parental psychological distress, and family relationships during the COVID-19 outbreak in China, BMC Psychiatry, 22, 1, (2022); Baird S., Alheiwidi S., Dutton R., Mitu K., Oakley E., Woldehanna T., Jones N., Social isolation and disrupted privacy, Girlhood Studies, 13, 3, pp. 98-115, (2020); Baird S., Murphy M., Seager J., Jones N., Malhotra A., Alheiwidi S., Emirie G., Rashid S., Sultan M., Intersecting disadvantages for married adolescents: Life after marriage pre- and post-COVID-19 in contexts of displacement, Journal of Adolescent Health, 70, 3S, pp. S86-S96, (2022); Banati P., Jones N., Youssef S., Intersecting vulnerabilities: The impacts of COVID-19 on the psycho-emotional lives of young people in low- and middle-income countries, European Journal of Development Research, 32, pp. 1613-1638, (2020); Barendse M.E.A., Flannery J., Cavanagh C., Aristizabal M., Becker S.P., Berger E., Breaux R., Campione-Barr N., Church J.A., Crone E.A., Dahl R.E., Dennis-Tiwary T.A., Dvorsky M.R., Dziura S.L., van de Groep S., Ho T.C., Killoren S.E., Langberg J.M., Larguinho T.L., Pfeifer J.H., Longitudinal change in adolescent depression and anxiety symptoms from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic, Journal of Research on Adolescence, (2022); Bellerose M., Diaw M., Pinchoff J., Kangwana B., Austrian K., Pre-pandemic influences on Kenyan girls’ transitions to adulthood during COVID-19, Girlhood Studies, 13, 3, pp. 113-150, (2020); Besser A., Flett G.L., Nepon T., Zeigler-Hill V., Personality, cognition, and adaptability to the COVID-19 pandemic: Associations with loneliness, distress, and positive and negative mood states, International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction, 20, 2, pp. 971-995, (2022); Biswas T., Scott J.G., Munir K., Renzaho A.M.N., Rawal L.B., Baxter J., Mamun A.A., Global variation in the prevalence of suicidal ideation, anxiety and their correlates among adolescents: A population based study of 82 countries, eClinicalMedicine, 24, (2020); Blackwell C.K., Mansolf M., Sherlock P., Ganiban J., Hofheimer J.A., Barone C.J., Wright R.J., Youth well-being during the Covid-19 pandemic, Pediatrics, 149, 4, (2022); Bourgault S., Peterman A., O'Donnell M.; Boursier V., Gioia F., Musetti A., Schimmenti A., COVID-19-related fears, stress and depression in adolescents: The role of loneliness and relational closeness to online friends, Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment, 1-23, (2022); Bravo-Sanzana M., Oriol X., Miranda R., Characterization of wellbeing and its relationship with exposure to violence in Mexican and Chilean early and late adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic, Child Indicators Research, 1-26, (2022); Bulow A., Keijsers L., Boele S., van Roekel E., Denissen J.J.A., Parenting adolescents in times of a pandemic: Changes in relationship quality, autonomy support, and parental control?, Developmental Psychology, 57, 10, pp. 1582-1596, (2021); Canady V.A., CDC data finds sharp rise in suicide attempts among teen girls amid COVID-19, Mental Health Weekly, 31, 24, (2021); Cao C., Wang L., Fang R., Liu P., Bi Y., Luo S., Grace E., Olff M., Anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms among high school students in China in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, Journal of Affective Disorders, 296, pp. 126-129, (2022); Cassinat J.R., Whiteman S.D., Serang S., Dotterer A.M., Mustillo S.A., Maggs J.L., Kelly B.C., Changes in family chaos and family relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from a longitudinal study, Developmental Psychology, 57, 10, pp. 1597-1610, (2021); Chaabane S., Doraiswamy S., Chaabna K., Mamtani R., Cheema S., The impact of COVID-19 school closure on child and adolescent health: A rapid systematic review, Children, 8, 5, (2021); Chaharbaghi Z., Hosseini F.B., Baniasadi T., Moradi L., Dana A., Impact of physical activity on resilience among teenage girls during the COVID-19 pandemic: A mediation by self-esteem.

Firstly, we conduct a qualitative analysis of both within-host and between-host models. For the within-host model, we prove the existence and stability of equilibria, and Hopf bifurcation occurs from the infection equilibrium with immune response. This implies that, under specific immune states, the virus within an infected individual may persist, and its concentration may also oscillate periodically. For the between-host model, the disease-free equilibrium always exists and is locally asymptotically stable when the epidemiological basic reproduction number ℜ0<1. In addition, the model can have boundary equilibria of strain 1 or strain 2, which are locally asymptotically stable under specific conditions. However, the co-existence equilibrium does not exist. Secondly, to explore the infection and transmission mechanisms of two strain models and obtain reliable parameter values, we utilize statistical data to fit the immuno-epidemiological model. Simultaneously, we conduct an identifiability analysis of the immuno-epidemiological model to ensure the robustness of the fitted parameters. The results demonstrate the reliable estimation of parameter ranges for structurally unidentifiable parameters with minor measurement errors using the affine invariant ensemble Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm (GWMCMC). Moreover, simulations illustrate that enhancing treatment of patients infected with BA.2 strains to inhibit the number of viruses released by infected cells can significantly reduce disease spread. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Between-host dynamics; Identifiability analysis; Immuno-epidemiology; Within-host dynamics,"Hattaf K., Yousfi N., Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection model with two modes of transmission and immune response, Math.

Healthcare systems had difficulty acquiring important supplies, such as face shields, which at that time were essential for healthcare staff. The need for this material increased with the spread of the pandemic. In most areas, warehouses did not have a sufficient stock of this product. This situation has occurred in the cities and provinces of Burgos (Spain). Volunteers (citizens and small companies) owning three-dimensional printers offered themselves to manufacture face shields. These volunteers are called “makers.” Similarly, different organizations (mainly Civil Protection) took charge of transport activities (delivery of material to the makers, collection of face shields, and delivery of the latter to hospitals and other entities). In this study, we were tasked with developing a system for planning and rationalizing these activities. The problems that were solved included a vehicle routing problem with different characteristics compared with other models in the literature. A previuous work described this problem, and the heuristic method used for the planning. However, it is necessary to develop tools that are as efficient as possible for similar situations. In this study, we propose a mathematical formulation of the problem and a method based on the metaheuristic strategies variable neighborhood search and greedy randomize adaptative search procedure on a multistart framework. Different tests with real instances used during the period in which these activities were conducted show that the new method improves the results obtained by the previous method as well as the commercial software. © 2023 The Authors.

Conventional techniques for SARS-CoV-2 detection have limitations, as high cost, low specificity, and longer analysis time, among others. Biosensors emerge as a necessary alternative to overcome the difficulties of current diagnostics. This paper reports a sensor platform where silver-doped zinc oxide nanomaterial (Ag:ZnONp) was used onto carbon screen-printed electrode and ethidium bromide as indicator for development of a specific electrochemical genosensor for COVID-19. This genosensor demonstrated good linearity between the concentrations of 5.62 × 104–5.62 copies/mL and a detection limit of 5 copies/mL with gRNA in patient's samples, with a response time within 30 min. Molecular modeling and morphological analysis are in agreement with obtained electrochemical results. Additional techniques such as AFM, SEM, and EIS were conducted to characterize the morphological and electrochemical properties of the biosensor's surface. The biosensor was also capable of detecting the target presence in spiked samples and demonstrated a stability of 60 days, higher than other similar biosensors for SARS-CoV-2. © 2024",Electrochemistry; Ethidium bromide; Genosensor; Point-of-care; SARS-CoV-2; Sensitivity,"Kim G.-U., Kim M.-J., Ra S.H., Lee J., Bae S., Jung J., Kim S.-H., Clinical characteristics of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with mild COVID-19, Clin.

Various forecasting models attempted to estimate the temporal course of the COVID-19 pandemic during this time period in order to determine effectiveness of the government action in facing COVID-19 outbreak. In this study, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were used in order to forecast the COVID-19 mortality rates data in Malaysia. The accuracy of the ARIMA models is then evaluated by using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Absolute Error (RMSE). The forecasting model with the lowest error is picked as the best. In this study, ARIMA (1,1,3) outperformed the ARIMA (1,1,2) and ARIMA (1,1,4) models since it has the lowest MAE and RMSE values. However, as compared to ARIMA (1,1,4), the study found that ARIMA (1,1,3) model is not adequate in terms of model fitting due to the errors were not normally distributed. Hence, ARIMA (1,1,4) model was chosen to make prediction of COVID-19 mortality rates. Accordingly, the findings through this study can be used as a preliminary study to predict the COVID-19 mortality rates and other future pandemic cases to mitigate risk of increasing cases. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

Various research results show that compared with Pfizer's Paxlovid and Merck's molnupiravir, Ensitrelvir is currently the most effective, safest and longest-lasting drug in the world! The synthesis of ensitrevir can be divided into four segments, and the docking of these four segments. Among them, the challenging segments are the triazole and indole segments due to the issue of methylation selectivity. In this study, DFT theory was primarily employed to investigate the activation energy of 1-methyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester and its positional isomers under different solvent conditions. Through experimental screening, selective methylation of 1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester was achieved. Subsequently, single crystals of the main product were cultivated, and calculations of electron density, nuclear magnetic resonance vibrations, etc., were performed for the three products to study the differences in the properties of various methylation products. Further structural confirmation of the three compounds was carried out using HMBC two-dimensional spectra. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Ensitrevir; Nsp5; Triazole, DFT","Tyrrell D.A., Bynoe M.L., Cultivation of viruses from a high proportion of patients with colds, Lancet, 1, 7428, pp. 76-77, (1966); Kahn J.S., McIntosh K., History and recent advances in coronavirus discovery, Pediatr.

It has the capability of generating income, creating job opportunities and help people to understand the culture diversity of other countries. Therefore, tourism demand forecasting is really needed to help the practitioners involved as well as government in pricing setting, in assessing future requirements of capacity to fulfil the customers’ demand or in making wise decisions on whether to explore new market or not. This study focuses on tourism demand forecasting based on the number of tourist arrival using recurrent neural network (RNN), which is long-short term memory (LSTM) model. The data used in this study is historical data of number of tourist arrivals in Malaysia before the onset of Movement Control Order (MCO) starting from January 2000 to February 2020 due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The data set was divided into two subsets, training and testing data sets based on ratio 80:20. The objective of this study is to determine an accurate forecasting model especially in tourism industry in Malaysia. The forecast evaluation implemented to predict the error of each model are Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the analyses for this model was performed by using Python software. Based on the results obtained, the LSTM model was considered as one of the accurate prediction methods for tourism demand in Malaysia due to the least error produced. It is hoped that these results can help the government as well as practitioners in tourism industry to make a right judgement and formulate better tourism plans in order to minimize any consequences in the future. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

The underlying premise is that stock prices should discount future company cash flows, and the projection of these cash flows can be proxied by investors' ability to forecast macroeconomic conditions. We assess stock market performance from January 2020 to February 2022 in 16 countries, equally split between developed and emerging markets. While results varied, the study suggests that stock markets generally predicted economic activity during Covid-19. The modeling test indicated that stock markets significantly predicted economic activity in 11 out of 16 countries, particularly in developed markets. Furthermore, incorporating the stock market as a variable, improved economic forecasts in all 16 countries. Unlike other studies that mainly focused on the characteristics of share price movements, this research judges the rationality of stock markets against an external criterion. Ultimately, it suggests that EMH was mostly vindicated during the Covid-19 period. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Covid-19; Economic Tracker; Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH); OECD countries,"Aylward A., Glen J., Some international evidence on stock prices as leading indicators of economic activity, Appl.

COVID-19 is broadly recognized with effects on multiple systems in the body, and various factors related to society, medicine, and genetics/epigenetics may contribute to the intensity and results of the disease. Additionally, a SARS-CoV-2 infection can activate pathological activities and expedite the emergence of existing health issues into clinical problems. Forming easily accessible, distinctive, and permeable biomarkers is essential for categorizing patients, preventing the disease, predicting its course, and tailoring treatments for COVID-19 individually. One promising candidate for such biomarkers is microRNAs, which could serve various purposes in understanding diverse forms of COVID-19, including susceptibility, intensity, disease progression, outcomes, and potential therapeutic options. This review provides an overview of the most significant findings related to the involvement of microRNAs in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Furthermore, it explores the function of microRNAs in a broad span of effects that may arise from accompanying or underlying health status. It underscores the value of comprehending how diverse conditions, such as neurological disorders, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and obesity, interact with COVID-19. © 2024 The Authors",COVID-19; Diabetes; Heart disease; microRNA; Neurological disease; Obesity,"Zhou P., Yang X.-L., Wang X.-G., Hu B., Zhang L., Zhang W., Et al., A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin, nature, 579, 7798, pp. 270-273, (2020); Zhang Q., Bastard P., Cobat A., Casanova J.-L., Human genetic and immunological determinants of critical COVID-19 pneumonia, Nature, 603, 7902, pp. 587-598, (2022); Giacomelli A., Ridolfo A.L., Pezzati L., Oreni L., Carrozzo G., Beltrami M., Et al., Mortality rates among COVID-19 patients hospitalised during the first three waves of the epidemic in Milan, Italy: a prospective observational study, PLoS One, 17, 4, (2022); Niemi M.E., Daly M.J., Ganna A., The human genetic epidemiology of COVID-19, Nat.

MRI data were processed using FSL to derive regional volumes for bilateral nucleus accumbens, caudate, pallidum, putamen, thalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus, and total grey matter, white matter, and cerebral spinal fluid volume, and analysed in relation to persistent COVID-19 symptom load, mental health, and sleep quality. Higher persistent COVID-19 symptom load was significantly associated with smaller putamen volume, lower response accuracy on working memory, executive function, and recognition memory tasks, as well as a longer time to complete the executive function task, and poorer mental health and sleep quality. Smaller putamen fully mediated the relationship between persistent COVID-19 symptom load and lower executive function. Further research is required to confirm whether reduced putamen volume and its association with poor executive function persists in COVID-19 survivors in the long term. © 2024 The Authors",Brain fog; Executive function; Mediation; Mild cognitive problems; Putamen; SARS-CoV-2,"Al-Qahtani A.A., Alhamlan F.S., Al-Qahtani A.A., Pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory interleukins in infectious diseases: a comprehensive review, Trop.

Few studies have assessed stress, depression, and public stigma of COVID-19 after the pandemic. This paper investigated stress, depression, and public stigma of COVID-19 among Thai University students. A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online questionnaire to assess stress, depression, and public stigma resulting from COVID-19 among Thai university students between 15 and 30 August 2022. The questionnaire was developed by the Department of Mental Health, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand. Public stigma was measured by the COVID-19 public stigma scale. The effects of public COVID-19 stigma on stress and depression were analyzed using multivariable multi-level logistic regression. A total of 2, 422 students completed the questionnaire. After multivariable analysis adjustment, students who experienced COVID-19 public stigma showed increased stress (AOR = 1.53; 95% CI [1.27–1.84]) and depression levels (AOR = 1.34; 95% CI [1.01–1.79]). Those who lived with high-risk COVID-19 individuals showed significant risk factors for stress, depression, and public stigma of COVID-19, while income presented the reverse effect. Those vaccinated with over two doses showed significantly reduced chances of depression. The COVID-19 public stigma plays a vital role in stress and depression levels among Thai university students. To mitigate stress and depression, an evaluation of public stigma is needed even after the pandemic. Further cohort studies are required to verify long-term results. © (2025), (Journal of Population and Social Studies).

The integration of information from CE and MS strengthens confidence in the identification of compounds present in clinical samples. The ability of CE to separate molecules based on their electrophoretic mobility coupled to MS enables the accurate identification and quantification of analytes, even in complex biological matrices such as human plasma.Here, we present a detailed protocol for an untargeted metabolomics study using CE-MS and its application in a study on human plasma from patients suffering Long COVID syndrome.

Methods: The COVID-19 in Antibody Deficiency (COV-AD) study was a United Kingdom study that enrolled 525 participants between April 2021 and September 2022. Data on health care utilisation was extracted from a screening cohort of participants at one participating site (Birmingham, UK). Hospital attendance (i.e. all outpatient and inpatient care episodes, including hospital-based IVIG treatment) and emergency care attendance patterns were analysed. Geographical differences in travel times to hospitals and associated costs were considered for all participants at all recruiting sites. Results: Individuals with antibody deficiency had a median of 7 hospital attendances per year. A diagnosis of secondary antibody deficiency, and antibody deficiency severe enough to require treatment with immunoglobulin replacement were associated with an increased frequency of hospital attendance. 12.7% of the cohort attended the Emergency Department at least once in the preceding twelve months. Individuals with secondary antibody deficiency were at greater risk of requiring emergency care over the preceding one-year and five-year periods. Individuals receiving subcutaneous immunoglobulin lived further from their local immunology centre and were more likely to engage with the COV-AD research study remotely, via dried blood spots sampling. Conclusion: This study highlights the utilisation of emergency and secondary care usage amongst patient with immunodeficiency and may inform service adaptation and development to better accommodate patient needs and circumstances. © The Author(s) 2024.",Healthcare Resource use; Inborn Errors of Immunity; Primary Immunodeficiency; Rare Disease; Secondary Immunodeficiency,"Krishna M.T., Et al., The impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Adult and Pediatric Allergy & Immunology Services in the UK National Health Service, J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract, 9, 2, pp. 709-e7222, (2021); Shields A.M., Et al., Outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiency in the United Kingdom, Clinical and Experimental Immunology, (2022); Ponsford M.J., Et al., A systematic review and Meta-analysis of Inpatient Mortality Associated with Nosocomial and Community COVID-19 exposes the vulnerability of immunosuppressed adults, Front Immunol, 6, 12, pp. 7446961664-3224, (2021); Pulvirenti F., Et al., Health-Related Quality of Life in Common Variable Immunodeficiency Italian patients switched to Remote Assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic, J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract, 8, 6, pp. 1894-e18992, (2020); Grigoriadou S.A., Et al., British Society for Immunology and United Kingdom Primary Immunodeficiency Network (UKPIN) consensus guideline for the management of immunoglobulin replacement therapy, Clin Exp Immunol, 210, pp. 1-13, (2022); Elhaj M.O., Et al., Dose reductions in immunoglobulin replacement are associated with increased antibiotic usage in patients with antibody deficiency, Br J Haematol, 202, 4, pp. 900-903, (2023); Richards N., The impact of remote care on burden of treatment, BMJ, (2022); Shields A.M., Et al., SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responses in individuals with antibody Deficiency: Findings from the COV-AD study, J Clin Immunol, 2022, pp. 1-12; Alligon M., Et al., An appraisal of the frequency and severity of noninfectious manifestations in primary immunodeficiencies: a study of a national retrospective cohort of 1375 patients over 10 years, J Allergy Clin Immunol, 149, 6, pp. 2216-2125, (2022); Mustafa Ali M.K., Et al., Hospital admissions secondary to diseases of the blood, blood-forming organs, and Immune System in England and Wales, Cureus, 14, 10, (2022); Coignard-Biehler H.A., Et al., A 1-Year prospective French Nationwide Study of Emergency Hospital Admissions in children and adults with primary immunodeficiency, J Clin Immunol, 37, 7, pp. 702-712, (2019); Gholami K., Et al., Costs of Hospital Admission on Primary Immunodeficiency diseases, Iran J Public Health, 46, 3, pp. 342-350, (2017); Shields A.M., Et al., Impact of vaccination on hospitalization and mortality from COVID-19 in patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiency: the United Kingdom experience, Front Immunol, 13, (2022); Shields A.M., Et al., Clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with symptomatic secondary immunodeficiency following the treatment of haematological malignancies, EJHaem, 4, 2, pp. 339-349, (2023); Ritchie B., Et al., Economic impact of self-administered subcutaneous versus clinic-administered intravenous immunoglobulin G therapy in Alberta, Canada: a population-based cohort study, Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol, 18, 1, (2022); Martin A., Et al., Economic benefits of subcutaneous rapid push versus intravenous immunoglobulin infusion therapy in adult patients with primary immune deficiency, Transfus Med, 23, 1, pp. 55-60, (2013); Alsina L., Et al., Cost-minimization analysis of immunoglobulin treatment of primary immunodeficiency diseases in Spain, Eur J Health Econ, 23, 3, pp. 551-558, (2022); Patel S.Y., Carbone J., Jolles S., The Expanding Field of secondary antibody Deficiency: causes, diagnosis, and management, Front Immunol, 10, (2019); Baron U., Et al., Epigenetic immune cell counting in human blood samples for immunodiagnostics, Sci Transl Med, 10, 452, (2018); Ferentinos P., Et al., Validation of dried blood spot sampling for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and total immunoglobulins in a large cohort of asymptomatic young adults, J Immunol Methods, 518, (2023)","A.M.

When conducting an in-depth analysis of microinfection dynamics, one must account for the substantial heterogeneity across countries. However, many commonly used statistical model specifications lack the flexibility needed for sound and accurate analysis and prediction in such contexts. Nonlinear mixed effects models (NLMMs) constitute a specific statistical tool that can overcome these significant challenges. While compartmental models are well-established in infectious disease modeling and have seen significant advancements, Nonlinear Mixed Models (NLMMs) offer a flexible approach for handling heterogeneous and unbalanced repeated measures data, often with less computational effort than some individual-level compartmental modeling techniques. This study provides an overview of their current use and offers a solid foundation for developing guidelines that may help improve their implementation in real-world situations. Relevant scientific databases in the Research4life Access initiative programs were used to search for papers dealing with key aspects of NLMMs in infectious disease modeling (IDM). From an initial list of 3641 papers, 124 were finally included and used for this systematic and critical review spanning the last two decades, following the PRISMA guidelines. NLMMs have evolved rapidly in the last decade, especially in IDM, with most publications dating from 2017 to 2021 (83.33%). The routine use of normality assumption appeared inappropriate for IDM, leading to a wealth of literature on NLMMs with non-normal errors and random effects under various estimation methods. We noticed that NLMMs have attracted much attention for the latest known epidemics worldwide (COVID-19, Ebola, Dengue and Lassa) with the robustness and reliability of relaxed propositions of the normality assumption. A case study of the application of COVID-19 data helped to highlight NLMMs’ performance in modeling infectious diseases. Out of this study, estimation methods, assumptions, and random terms specification in NLMMs are key aspects requiring particular attention for their application in IDM. © 2024 The Authors",Comparison;

The best approach to forestall this pandemic is to avoid exposure to the virus. Therefore, medical protective equipment is essential for fighting this pandemic. This underlines the chief role of having a sustainable supply chain network (SCN) for producing and distributing personal protective equipment to avoid shortage and augmenting costs. The reality, however, is that the COVID-19 pandemic leads to many developments in countries and this study is another step for these purposes. This research develops a multi-period, multi-objective, multi-echelon, and multi-product medical protective equipment sustainable SCN considering the production, distribution, allocation, and inventory with “risk pooling” strategy effect with the aim of filling the existing gaps in health SCN research during the COVID-19 pandemic. By applying the risk pooling strategy, lower inventory levels or higher service levels can be achieved without increasing inventory costs. This model explores the possibility of lateral transshipments between distribution centers, as a way to increase the reliability of SCN performance. We model a new production, inventory, distribution, location, and allocation problem and consider four objectives for our suggested model (i) minimizing total SCN costs, (ii) minimizing environmental effects, (iii) minimizing social impacts, and (iv) maximizing the reliability of demand delivery. The proposed model simultaneously examines all three dimensions of sustainability (economic, environmental, and social) as well as the reliability of demand delivery. Considering all of these decisions and assumptions brings the studied problem closer to reality. We employ various algorithms for solving our developed model with different sizes: the improved version of the augmented ε-constraint (AUGMECON2) algorithm for small and medium-sized problems and two meta-heuristic algorithms, i.e., Multi-Objective Whale Optimization Algorithm (MOWOA) and Multi-Objective Variable Neighborhood Search (MOVNS) algorithm, for large-sized ones. The Taguchi approach is used to tune the parameters of meta-heuristic algorithms, and a comparison is performed using four evaluation metrics: Mean Ideal Distance (MID), Number of Pareto Solutions (NPS), Maximum Spread (MS), and Spread of Non-Dominance Solution (SNS). Proposed solving methods for the studied problem and making comparisons between them are another innovation of this study. A couple of numerical examples are provided to illustrate the applicability of the presented solution methods. Finally, sensitivity analysis for problem parameters is performed to validate our suggested model. Our study reveals the superiority of the MOWOA over the other algorithms. © 2024 The Author(s)",COVID-19; Metaheuristics; Reliability; Sustainable healthcare network,"Abbasi S., Sicakyuz C., Erdebilli B., Designing the home healthcare supply chain during a health crisis, Journal of Engineering Research, 11, 4, pp. 447-452, (2023);

Stool samples from infected patients were used as endogenous viral material to more accurately mirror real-world decay processes compared to more traditionally used lab-propagated spike-ins. As such, this study includes data on early decay stages of endogenous viral targets in wastewaters that are typically overlooked when performing decay studies on wastewaters harvested from wastewater treatment plants that contain already-degraded endogenous material. The two distinct sewer transport conditions of dynamic suspended sewer transport and bed and near-bed sewer transport were simulated in this study at temperatures of 4 °C, 12 °C and 20 °C to elucidate decay under these two dominant transport conditions within wastewater infrastructure. The dynamic suspended sewer transport was simulated over 35 h, representing typical flow conditions, whereas bed and near-bed transport extended to 60 days to reflect the prolonged settling of solids in sewer systems during reduced flow periods. In dynamic suspended sewer transport, no decay was observed for SARS-CoV-2, PMMoV, or total RNA over the 35-h period, and temperature ranging from 4 °C to 20 °C had no noticeable effect. Conversely, experiments simulating bed and near-bed transport conditions revealed significant decreases in SARS-CoV-2 and total RNA concentrations by day 2, and PMMoV concentrations by day 3. Only PMMoV exhibited a clear trend of increasing decay constant with higher temperatures, suggesting that while temperature influences decay dynamics, its impact may be less significant than previously assumed, particularly for endogenous RNA that is bound to dissolved organic matter in wastewater. First order decay models were inadequate for accurately fitting decay curves of SARS-CoV-2, PMMoV, and total RNA in bed and near-bed transport conditions. F-tests confirmed the superior fit of the two-phase decay model compared to first order decay models across temperatures of 4 °C–20 °C. Finally, and most importantly, total RNA normalization emerged as an appropriate approach for correcting the time decay of SARS-CoV-2 exposed to bed and near-bed transport conditions. These findings highlight the importance of considering decay from the point of entry in the sewers, sewer transport conditions, and normalization strategies when assessing and modelling the impact of viral decay rates in wastewater systems. This study also emphasizes the need for ongoing research into the diverse and multifaceted factors that influence these decay rates, which is crucial for accurate public health monitoring and response strategies. © 2024",Bed transport; Decay rate; Degradation testing; Persistence testing; Stool spike-in; Wastewater-based surveillance,"Ahmed W., Angel N., Edson J., Bibby K., Bivins A., O'Brien J.W., Choi P.M., Kitajima M., Simpson S.L., Li J., Tscharke B., Verhagen R., Smith W.J.M., Zaugg J., Dierens L., Hugenholtz P., Thomas K.V., Mueller J.F., First confirmed detection of SARS-CoV-2 in untreated wastewater in Australia: a proof of concept for the wastewater surveillance of COVID-19 in the community, Sci.

Recently, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become severe global pandemic. Particularly, the Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging has become an essentiality in COVID-19 detection. As a result, the convergence of CADx technology with Chest X-ray analysis has achieved great efficiency in COVID-19 diagnosis. Therefore, the research value of CADx in COVID-19 diagnosis is exceptionally high. This study aims to evaluate different k-means based clustering algorithms and identifying the one with the highest overall accuracy. First of all, 150 COVID-19 CXR open-source images are acquired from Kaggle and Github. All the images will be unified into a same image size with 1000*1000 pixels and quality during the image pre-processing. Next, the resized images are enhanced by the Modified Global Contrast Stretching (MGCS) enhancement method to increase the quality of images. Then, the traditional k-means, k-medians, k-medoids and fast k-means clustering methods have been implemented in the image segmentation. At the same time, five different numbers <2, 4, 6, 8, 10> of clusters also tested out in this study. Lastly, all the segmented is proceeded to the segmentation performance based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, recall and F-score. The result proves that the k-medoids clustering algorithm with 2 clusters archived the best overall segmentation performance as it obtained the highest sensitivity, accuracy, recall and F-score with 66.14%, 87.98%, 0.6614 and 0.7327. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

We modelled the information transfers across different periods of global shocks – the Federal Reserve Bank normalisation post the Global Financial Crisis, oil price shocks, BREXIT, the U.S.-China trade war, and COVID-19. Information interactions from advanced to African markets were moderate, occasionally mixed, and insignificant, leaving room for portfolio diversification. We also discovered some progress regarding the integration process between the developed and African markets on the back of noticeable information exchanges. Our findings from the information exchanges indicate that the stock markets of South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, and Kenya have led the integration process ahead of their peers. To robust-check our results, we employed the wavelet multiple correlation (WMC) technique by modelling the multi-structure relationship among all the stock markets and confirmed the fast integration between the South African stock market and the developed markets. Our WMC results also revealed that portfolio diversification opportunities are feasible in the short term. The results present important implications for optimal risk management strategies and policy measures to anchor markets to withstand shocks. © 2024 The Authors",Advanced markets; African stocks; Entropy; Information transfer,"Aderibigbe T., Adegboye K., Osayi V., Okorie S., Iyang E., Opportunities and problems of investment in the african stock exchange: a selection of NSE, GSE, & RSE, J.

How can these solutions influence cognitive processes and responses, leading to positive results for brands and their customers? The research seeks to answer the question through a qualitative experimental research, bringing together participants from different generations in order to provide an inclusive overview of user behavior when faced with these solutions. The sample of twenty-five volunteers was distributed equally into five different groups or generations: Silent Generation, Baby Boomers, Generation X, Generation Y, and Generation Z. With the aim of understanding and tracing experience through the users’ perspective, the experiments included a questionnaire and focus group session, which included the application of complementary techniques, as the Experience Compelling Map, to ensure greater reliability in results. Through this study, a general and inclusive overlook of consumer behavior was obtained as well as an integrated overview of the topic, providing a better understanding for both non-specialists and specialists and contributing to Design practice. The results were compared and generated fourteen guidelines that can become alternatives to enhance physical retail experience. © 2025 Common Ground Research Networks.

A novelty of this work is the methodology used to determine the form and radius of influence on these prices (monotonically decreasing buffer with threshold) of heritage monuments as tourist attractions. The methodology is applied to a case study of the city of Granada, Spain, although it could be extrapolated to other cities displaying similar characteristics. The results indicate that commercial rental prices varied in a non-uniform manner throughout the city during the COVID-19 pandemic and that the main streets and prime locations were the most affected. The proposed methodology can be used to guide political and business decision-making in other disruptive situations. © 2024 The Authors",Buffer; Commercial premises price prediction; COVID-19; Hedonic model; Heritage; Pedestrian walkability; Rental prices,"Ahlfeldt G.M., Maennig W., Substitutability and complementarity of urban amenities: external effects of built heritage in Berlin, R.

This study aims to analyse virtual laboratory research trends for practical learning in vocational education through bibliometric analysis by taking data from Scopus (intro/issue). The method used in this bibliometric journal article is the bibliometric method. This research step consists of (i) determining search keywords, (ii) collection of publication data, (iii) bibliometric data processing, (iv) bibliometric data mapping, and (v) data analysis. The search keywords used to collect data were ""Virtual laboratory,"" ""Vocational,"" and ""Education."" There are 31 articles indexed by Scopus from 2002 to 2023. From 2019 to 2023, research on virtual laboratories in vocational education has increased. This is because access to computer technology, the internet, and mobile devices is increasingly widespread, and a surge in technology use occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the bibliometric mapping analysis show there are 24 terms grouped into 3 clusters. The terms virtual laboratory and vocational education are related in research. Virtual laboratories help overcome problems in vocational education, especially for productive vocational subjects such as working on dangerous equipment. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

Our model has K+4 compartments. K-1 of these compartments represent additional subsequent vaccination stages not considered in the original SVIR model, while a further compartment accounts for dead people. We analyze the equilibrium points of the model. A time-varying parameters version of it, having K=3 vaccination compartments, is then calibrated to Italian COVID-19 dataset. This analysis is carried out for three specific sub-periods: the first one, ranging from February 24th, 2020, up to December 26th 2020, when no vaccines were available; the second one, from the December 27th, 2020 up to December 31st, 2021, during which the Delta variant of the virus prevailed and Delta-targeted vaccination doses were administered to the population for the first time; finally, the last considered period is ranging from January 10th, 2022 up to June 3rd, 2022, and it was characterized by the diffusion of the Omicron variant. To tackle the problem of undetected infected or undetected recovered people we adopt an approach relying on different scenarios. The calibration of the model uses the property that the discrete-time version of it turns out to be explicitly solvable with respect to the parameters, hence providing a daily estimate of the involved parameters. This produces meaningful evolution patterns of the COVID-19 epidemic which allow a better understanding of the diffusive behavior of the pandemic along time. Lastly a statistical analysis of the epidemiological parameters estimators supports the non stationarity of their time series. © 2024 The Author(s)",Compartmental epidemic models; Covid-19; Dynamic simulations; Equilibrium states,"Liu X., Takeuchi Y., Iwami S., SVIR epidemic models with vaccination strategies, J.

This paper presents a meta-analytical study and builds a framework of employee perceptions of CSR and their antecedents, outcomes, and conditional variables in tourism and hospitality. Results based on 143 correlations from 65 studies indicated that employee perceptions of CSR are related to antecedents including transformational, ethical, and servant leadership, as well as related to outcomes including firm performance, reputation, employee psychological states, and behavioural responses. The study examined potential moderating variables including national culture, industry type, and COVID-19 pandemic phase. This meta-analytic research promotes the advancement of the employee perceptions of CSR literature and provides effective guidance for managers to understand CSR practices. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Antecedents;

However, it also contributes to environmental degradation, particularly in terms of air quality, which impacts public health. This research applies the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method, a sustainability matrix, to gauge the environmental impact of Jakarta's public transportation system. Our study aims to identify car emissions and understand the environmental consequences they pose. The research was scoped to examine both the raw materials and energy input and the resultant emissions. Specifically, we analyzed the electricity consumption of Jakarta's MRT, Bus Trans Jakarta, and online taxi services. We utilized the LCA methodology and the SimaPro 9.1 software for assessment. Prior research data were incorporated to enhance the accuracy of our LCA model. A notable observation is the decline in public transportation usership since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Current health protocols allow only half the usual passenger capacity, compounded by a sluggish economy. Our findings reveal that the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT)'s CO2 emissions, at 0.019 kg/passenger/kilometer, are significantly lower than that of the BRT at 0.036 kg/passenger/kilometer. One recommendation to further reduce emissions is to transition buses from diesel to compressed natural gas (CNG) fuel. However, public adoption of these changes will largely hinge on individual preferences. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

Several technical studies have also been done to develop the modules that meet the operational requirements in Malaysia and determine their benefits and impacts on farmers. Despite the availability of smart farming technologies and their benefits to farmers’ productivity and profitability, adoption of smart farming among Malaysian farmers, especially in rural areas, remains a challenge. Therefore, a qualitative study among farmers in Sarawak and Sabah was conducted to determine the challenges that arise with the adoption of smart farming technologies. The results highlighted that farmer faced challenges in regard to the high startup cost of technology, lack of expertise and knowledge on technologies, connectivity and access in rural areas, farm size, and governmental support.

Mathematical models assessing past booster campaigns and integrating knowledge on waning of immunity can help better inform current and future vaccination programs. Focusing on the first booster campaign in the 2021/2022 winter in France, we used a multi-strain age-stratified transmission model to assess the effectiveness of the observed booster vaccination in controlling the succession of Delta, Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 waves. We explored counterfactual scenarios altering the eligibility criteria and inter-dose delay. Our study showed that the success of the immunization program in curtailing the Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 waves was largely dependent on the inclusion of adults among the eligible groups, and was highly sensitive to the inter-dose delay, which was changed over time. Shortening or prolonging this delay, even by only one month, would have required substantial social distancing interventions to curtail the hospitalization peak. Also, the time window for adjusting the delay was very short. Our findings highlight the importance of readiness and adaptation in the formulation of routine booster campaign in the current level of epidemiological uncertainty. © 2024 The Authors",Age-structured model;

Unfortunately, there is currently no cure for PF. ShaShen-MaiDong decoction (SMT), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been employed in treating various lung diseases, which may offer potential therapeutic benefits for PF. Aim of the study: To investigate the antifibrotic efficacy of SMT and its major active ingredients as well as the underlying mechanisms for treating PF. Materials and methods: Fist, we build the UPLC-MS based qualitative and quantitative profiling for the quality control of SMT. Then, the antifibrotic efficacy of SMT was investigated in bleomycin (BLM)-induced PF mice model. Network pharmacology was used to predict the mechanism and active components of SMT for the treatment of PF, which was further verified in vitro and in vivo. Results: SMT improved the weight loss and attenuated hydroxyproline, inflammatory cytokines, and collagen deposition in BLM-induced PF mice model in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, as predicted by network pharmacology analysis, SMT and its active compounds (kaempferol, quercetin, and isorhamnetin) regulated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, and YAP/TAZ signaling pathway, which was further verified in the PF mice and TGF-β-induced A549 cell model. Moreover, SMT balanced the proportions of increased CD4+ and decreased CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of PF mice model. Conclusions: Considering the high mortality and complex pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases, our results provide novel evidence that SMT would be beneficial for pulmonary fibrosis therapy by modulating MAPK, TGF-β/Smad, and YAP/TAZ signaling pathways at same time. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Active ingredients; MAPK; Pulmonary fibrosis; ShaShen-MaiDong decoction; TGF-β/Smad; YAP/TAZ,"Ambardar S.R., Hightower S.L., Huprikar N.A., Chung K.K., Singhal A., Collen J.F., Post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis: novel sequelae of the current pandemic, J.

As a result, the current study aims to investigate the effect of student motivation on grouping e-learning in the ethics and civilization course. A total of 88 students from agriculture, fishing, and forestry were chosen to participate in the experiment. Students participated in online synchronous lectures for seven weeks and another seven weeks in online group presentations. After 14 weeks, students were given the attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction (ARCS) motivation model questionnaire to assess their motivation on the course. As a result, the ARCS questionnaire score was 4.62, indicating that student learning motivation was adequate. Furthermore, forestry students outperformed agricultural and fishery students in terms of ARCS model score. Male students who participated in the online grouping presentation had the greatest ARCS model score compared to female students. As a result, using an online group presentation learning system for asynchronous learning is possible and beneficial, particularly for male learners. © 2025, Intelektual Pustaka Media Utama.
