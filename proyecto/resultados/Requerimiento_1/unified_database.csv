"On Computational Tools, Computational Thinking and Computational Methods",X. Zhang; H. Zou,2009,"The appearance and innovation of computational tools depends on human thinking and initiative, and on the other hand, human thinking is affected by computational tools. The strong function of computational tools in some aspect is superior to that of human brains. It is the application of such strong function that changes the face of human society. At the same time, it presents new methods for scientific research and new perspective for solving problems, promotes human thinking to a higher level, and presents new means for people to understand and change the world. The advantage of computational tools over human brains is the speed, while the initiative ability of human brains is not owned by computational tools. Perfect combination of thinking and computing gives birth to a series of achievements, and lays the foundation of science.",10.1109/ETCS.2009.120,IEEE,3.0,IEEE,computational tools;computational thinking;computational methods,IEEE Conferences,Chile,Computers & Education

"Integrating Mathematical Thinking, Abstract Thinking, and Computational Thinking",K. McMaster; B. Rague; N. Anderson,2010,"In recent years, several groups of Computer Science educators have made a sustained effort to capture the essence of CS apart from programming. Three of these approaches are Mathematical Thinking, Abstract Thinking, and Computational Thinking. Each approach tries to clarify areas of CS that are not directly tied to writing computer programs. In a separate line of research, the current authors have been examining different ways to teach mathematics to CS students. We developed a Computational Math scale that measures the level of problem-solving gestalt exhibited by textbook authors. In this study, we relate our Computational Math framework to current research on Mathematical, Abstract, and Computational (MAC) Thinking. We counted words used frequently in research articles and compared them to words that form the Computational Math scale. Our results suggest an overall MAC Thinking framework that integrates a wide range of topics relevant to computing and programming.",10.1109/FIE.2010.5673139,IEEE,10.0,IEEE,Abstraction;Algorithm;Computational Math;Model;Thinking,IEEE Conferences,Brazil,Science Advances

Construction and Application of a Computational Thinking Assessment Framework from the Perspective of the Iceberg Model,X. Zhou; W. Zhang; S. Wang; H. Chen,2023,"Computational thinking assessment is an important part of testing the effectiveness of computational thinking cultivation. However, the existing computational thinking assessments still suffer from the problem of insufficient examination of non-cognitive factors, leading to the lack of validity of its assessment results.

Improving learning of computational thinking using creative thinking exercises in CS-1 computer science courses,L. D. Miller; L. -K. Soh; V. Chiriacescu; E. Ingraham; D. F. Shell; S. Ramsay; M. P. Hazley,2013,"Promoting computational thinking is one of the top priorities in CS education as well as in other STEM and non-STEM disciplines. Our innovative NSF-funded IC2Think project blends computational thinking with creative thinking so that students leverage their creative thinking skills to “unlock” their understanding of computational thinking. In Fall 2012, we deployed creative exercises designed to engage Epstein's creative competencies (Surrounding, Capturing, Challenging and Broadening) in introductory level CS courses targeting four different groups (CS, engineering, combined CS/physical sciences, and humanities majors). Students combined hands-on problem solving with guided analysis and reflection to connect their creative activities to CS topics such as conditionals and arrays and to real-world CS applications. Evaluation results (approximately 150 students) found that creative thinking exercise completion had a linear “dosage” effect. As students completed more exercises [0/1 – 4], they increased their long-term retention [a computational thinking test], F(3, 98) = 4.76, p =.004, partial Eta2 = .127 and course grades, F(3, 109) = 4.32, p =.006, partial Eta2 = .106.

Fostering Critical and Computational Thinking in the Field of Primary and Secondary Education in non-STEM Subjects by Using Data Sets and Applications,I. Vlahović; I. O. Biškupić,2023,"Critical and computational thinking in primary and secondary education in recent years shows growing importance in methodical approaches used in the classroom. Although many examples exist for using critical and computational thinking in STEM educational area, the social sciences i.e., non-STEM areas were somehow left out due to the relatively more difficult design of such content, especially in the part of the development of computational thinking. In that context, in this paper we present one way of using critical and computational thinking in non-STEM education, more specifically on the example of historical data sources, through the use of programming in Python. As an example, we use historical data for Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade routes, that were the largest long-distance coerced movement of people in history up to the mid-nineteenth century, for connecting concepts of databases, Data Science and programming for development of critical and computational thinking in context of history science. This way of using modern approaches in classroom should give teachers and pupils a broader picture of importance of interdisciplinary education for critical and computational thinking development through STEM and non-STEM classes that give pupils novel skills needed for future labor market.",10.23919/MIPRO57284.2023.10159750,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Critical Thinking;Computational Thinking;STEM;non-STEM;Data Science;programming;Python;history;Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade routes,IEEE Conferences,China,Computers & Education
Helping Novice Programmers to Bootstrap in the Cloud: Incorporating Support for Computational Thinking into the Game Design Process,N. Ahmadi; M. Jazayeri; M. Landoni,2012,"Game design environments are traditionally used as means for engaging non-programmers in the learning process. However, these environments lack specific support for teaching computational thinking to novices. Typically, such skills are acquired in ad hoc practical sessions with supervision provided by teachers or peers. The usual scenario is where a teacher guides the students in solving these problems during a game design session. In informal learning settings, step-by-step tutorials for creating existing games are used to compensate for the lack of computer support for solving design and computational problems. In this paper we suggest a game design process that combines support for computational thinking with tool usage, by identifying the most common computational thinking problems and providing a generic solution to them. We have evaluated our solution in the context of AgentWeb, an online cloud-based game design environment for novices. We discuss how to incorporate suggested computational thinking solutions as computer assistant into the game design user interface.",10.1109/ICALT.2012.24,IEEE,5.0,IEEE,end-user programming;computational thinking;design thinking;game design environments;informal learning;cognitive walkthrough;cloud-based environments,IEEE Conferences,Germany,Computers & Education
Influence of Programming Robot Learning Mode Based on Conceptual Mapping on College Students' Computational Thinking,B. -H. Chen; L. -H. Chen; C. -C. Chen; C. -H. Chen,2021,"As the information age has progressed, computational thinking ability to solve problems has become an indispensable way of life in life. Many scholars believe that the process of solving problems will be more logical if they have computational thinking ability. At the same time, scholars believe that a good learning method improves learners' intrinsic motivation. Therefore, in this research, we try to use conceptual mapping so that students can construct knowledge when composing their own images, as the focus of this learning model and computational thinking is the thinking process and the two coincide. This research intends to introduce the traditional programming robot course into conceptual mapping and measure whether there are differences in computational thinking tendencies, problem-solving tendencies, and intrinsic motivations between students who use conceptual mapping and those who do not use it. The students in the experimental group with conceptual mapping activities developed computational thinking skills during the program robotics course.

Computational thinking tools,A. Repenning; A. Basawapatna; N. Escherle,2016,"Computational Thinking is an essential skill for all students in the 21st Century. A fundamental question is how can we create computer affordances to empower novice teachers and students, in a variety of STEM and art disciplines, to think computationally while avoiding difficult overhead emerging from traditional coding? Over the last 20 years we have iteratively developed tools that aim to support computational thinking. As these tools evolved a philosophy emerged to support Computational Thinking by joining human abilities with computer affordances. Chief among these findings is that supporting Computational Thinking is much more than making coding accessible.

Improving Computational Thinking Competencies in STEM Higher Education,N. Dehbozorgi; M. Roopaei,2024,"Computational thinking (CT) is a key competency with a significant impact on students' academic performance in STEM fields. It empowers students to enhance problem-solving skills by decomposing problems, utilizing abstraction and pattern recognition, and employing algorithmic thinking to design solutions and build models. This is particularly important in STEM disciplines where logical reasoning is essential for addressing complex real-world challenges in academic and industrial settings. Given the increasing demand for professionals equipped with strong algorithmic thinking and problem-solving abilities in Industry 5, educational institutions are focusing on enhancing students' CT and problem-solving skills. This study presents an initiative conducted over the past two years at our institute to teach CT in a gateway course to students with different backgrounds in STEM fields. The approach involved designing specific learning modules on Abstraction, Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, and Algorithmic Thinking and integrating them into the LMS. After studying these learning modules, the students were exposed to specific assignments that required the application of related CT skills. Pre and post surveys were employed by using standard CT tests to measure the impact of the intervention on students' CT levels. The results indicated an improvement in students' perceptions of their mastery of CT. Academic course grades also showed an improvement, with increased A scores and reduced F grades post-intervention. This two-year study on improving CT skills has yielded promising results. Moving forward, the research aims to enhance the existing modules further and distribute them to a broader range of introductory-level STEM courses in other universities. This future direction aligns with the goal of expanding the impact of CT education and integrating it more widely into STEM curricula.",10.1109/ISEC61299.2024.10664997,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Computational Thinking;Higher Education;Integrated STEM Education;Student Performance,IEEE Conferences,Spain,Nature Communications

A Guide Towards a Definition of Computational Thinking in K-12,R. Ismail; T. A. Steinbach; C. S. Miller,2022,"Computational thinking (CT) has been described as a set of valuable skills for tackling complex problems. To foster CT among K-12 students, different initiatives have been introduced by governmental and non-governmental entities, and numerous studies have been carried out by researchers to define and integrate CT into school curriculum. However, previous studies has shown little agreement among researchers, governmental and non-governmental sectors about a unified CT definition. These dissensions have introduced challenges in formulating a definition for CT at the K-12 level. The absence of a unified definition may increase the challenges for teachers to teach and integrate CT into school curriculum. To foster CT among K-12 students, we introduce a definition and framework for CT. We evaluated 39 articles and extracted the most common elements used in the literature to frame CT definition and describe its elements. Several studies have discussed, as well as investigated, the significance of conceptualizing and comprehending the interaction and dependency relationships among computational objects. However, our literature review discovered that little attention has been dedicated to the concept of dependency in the CT body of knowledge. Based on the literature review, we define CT as the thought process used for solving problems, and it encompasses the elements of problem decomposition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking. We conjecture the CT definition is missing the element of dependency. In the context of CT, we define dependency as the knowledge of comprehending the interrelationships between different sections of a decomposed problem.",10.1109/EDUCON52537.2022.9766703,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Computational Thinking (CT);K-12 Education;Dependency;Abstraction;Decomposition;Algorithmic Thinking,IEEE Conferences,India,Computers & Education

CS for ALL: Introducing Computational Thinking with Hands-On Experience in College,A. Jung; J. Park; A. Ahn; M. Yun,2017,"CS for ALL is a new education initiative launched in 2016 to empower a generation of American students with the computer science skills they need to thrive in a digital economy. In order to keep up with trends in the growing technology-driven world, students should have the ability to analyze and consider the consequences of computing problems critically. However, introducing CS and computational thinking skills to the first year students in college is a difficult task because the nature of the subject tends to be dry and conceptual. Thus, we introduce a computer science course that helps all undergraduate students to prepare for digital life as well as enhance their critical thinking skills through hands-on learning experiences. The course contents introduce the general concept of computer science such as computing system, basic networking, algorithms and programming with Scratch and mBot robot exercises. Our student feedback shows a high level of enthusiasm and engagement among the students. The strong hands-on learning nature of the course helped our students to have more engaging and interactive classroom experiences.",10.1109/CSCI.2017.187,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Computer Science Education;Computational Thinking;Hands-on;Robot programming,IEEE Conferences,UK,Journal of Computer Science

An Investigation of Undergraduates’ Computational Thinking in a Sophomore-Level Biomedical Engineering Course,H. Shoaib; M. Cardella; A. Madamanchi; D. Umulis,2019,"This research study presents our work focused on studying the development of introductory computational thinking in undergraduate biomedical engineering students. In response to the growing computational intensity of the healthcare industry, biomedical engineering (BME) undergraduate education is starting to emphasize computation and computational thinking. Computational thinking is a way of thinking that uses concepts and methodologies of computing to solve problems in interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary subjects. In broader terms, computational thinking is not only associated with using computational tools but also with the thought process of solving a problem by data representation, problem decomposition, and algorithm design. Despite being so important, there is little research work or information available on the development of computational thinking in BME undergraduate students. Our research focuses on how BME undergraduate students develop computational thinking skills while performing group activities related to problem-solving. In order to conduct this study, we incorporate a teaching methodology that prompts computational thinking in a thermodynamics course being taught at a public mid-western university to approximately 120 sophomore students. We observe classroom activities involving analytical problem solving followed by pseudo code generation for computational coding. In order to investigate computational thinking, we collect classroom observations of small groups of students as they come up with a solution to an analytical problem with each other. We complement the observation notes of the classroom activities with follow up semi structured interviews with individual students from five groups. Thematic analysis of the student interviews is used in order to analyze student responses towards the incorporation of computation intensive teaching methodology. This Work in Progress helps us expand our understanding of computational thinking development and the challenges involved in performing computational thinking activity in BME undergraduate students.",10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028503,IEEE,2.0,IEEE,thermodynamics;computational thinking,IEEE Conferences,Japan,Journal of Computer Science

An Ontology based approach to teach Computational Thinking,C. Araújo; L. V. O. Lima; P. R. Henriques,2019,"This paper is focused on the teaching/learning process of Computational Thinking at primary and secondary schools. It is generally accepted that Programming is a complex task that requires a long learning process. Theoretical knowledge about fundamentals on algorithms and data structures, as well as, on programming languages are required but are not enough; practicing a lot is also necessary. However, teaching Computer Programming is a hard job, most of the times unsuccessful. To overcome all the difficulties, felt by teachers and students, an increasingly bigger community of researchers in Computer Science is defending the importance of teaching Computational Thinking to young students to train them, since very earlier, in logic and abstract reasoning for problem solving. Our starting point to approach this topic relies on the use of an Ontology (OntoCnE) that describes in detail the concepts “Computational Thinking” and “Programming”, and maps those concepts to different education levels, starting with the first year. We believe that a person just acquires a new way of thinking, or a new way of behaving, if he is trained with the appropriate learning resources. So a main investment to educate people in Computational Thinking is on the choice/creation of those convenient resources. In particular we intended to investigate the impact of Augmented Reality in the usefulness of the referred resources. In that direction we will also discuss the development of a Web Platform to help on collecting and classifying (according to the referred ontology) learning resources to be used by teachers in computing classes. On the other hand, the platform will help on the retrieval, from that repository, of the most adequate resources to teach a specific subject to a specific level.",10.1109/SIIE48397.2019.8970131,IEEE,6.0,IEEE,computational thinking;programming;learning resource;teacher support tools;ontology,IEEE Conferences,Japan,Nature Communications

Correlation analysis is used to explore the relationship between students' computational thinking skills (CTS) and their five personality traits: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness. 219 college students completed the CT Assessment Test and the Big Five Personality Inventory. The results showed that there were statistically significant correlations between CTS and extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness, among which openness had the greatest impact on CTS, and extraversion and conscientiousness had moderate effects on CTS. These results are consistent with the conclusions of most related literatures, confirming the existence of non-cognitive influencing factors of CT.

As such, an increasing number of bachelor's and master's programs outside of the CS discipline integrate CT courses within their study program. At the same time, tools such as notebooks and interactive apps designed to support the teaching of programming concepts are becoming ever more popular. However, in non-CS majors, CT might not be perceived as essential, and students might lack the motivation to engage with such tools in order to acquire solid CT skills. This article presents a field study conducted with 115 students during a full semester on a novel computational notebook environment. It evaluates computational notebooks and CT skills in an introductory course on information technology for first-year undergraduates in business and economics. A multidimensional evaluation approach makes use of pre- and post-test surveys, lectures, and self-directed laboratory sessions tracking analytics.

A strategy to assess computational thinking,A. Gonzalez-Torres; L. Sancho-Chavarria; M. Zuniga-Cespedes; J. Monge-Fallas; J. Navas-Su,2021,"Computational Thinking (CT) is a method of analysis and problem solving that enables the development of life skills and positively influences the social and competitive conditions of people. This type of thinking promotes learning through the application of planning, analysis, abstraction and decomposition of problems into their constituent parts. In addition, PC contributes to the formation of critical thinking, creativity and cooperation between people. In education, the mechanisms used to foster CP are diverse; among them, learning through programming. Databases of source code generated in learning exercises using the CP method are a valuable tool for discovering learning patterns. However, there are no robust and scalable methods for studying the huge source code bases of learning products to recognize the predominant patterns and determine the effectiveness of the method. Consequently, a comprehensive analysis of learners’ skills, knowledge, outcomes and performance levels is necessary to identify points of improvement to meet learning objectives and modify curricula and exercises.

Intended Outcomes: The outcomes of this approach include significant improvements in various dimensions of students’ creativity (fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration) and enhanced CT skills, particularly in medium and hard tasks. Application Design: The study involved 54 junior high school seventh-graders, with 28 students in the experimental group and 26 students in the comparison group. The experimental group was exposed to a semester of STEAM PBL, while the comparison group followed the regular curriculum. Findings: After a semester of STEAM PBL, the experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in creativity dimensions, while the comparison group showed no significant changes. In terms of CT skills, the experimental group exhibited significant improvements in medium and hard tasks, whereas the comparison group did not. These results highlight the potential benefits of integrating STEAM into PBL as a transdisciplinary teaching approach for enhancing students’ creativity and CT skills. The implications for educational practice and future research are discussed in depth.",10.1109/TE.2023.3297221,IEEE,1.0,IEEE,Computational thinking (CT);creativity;design thinking (DT);project-based learning (PBL);Science;Technology;Engineering;Arts;and Mathematics (STEAM),IEEE Journals,Germany,Science Advances

Chiriacescu; E. Ingraham,2014,"Promoting computational thinking is a priority in CS education and other STEM and non-STEM disciplines. Our innovative, NSF-funded IC2Think project blends computational and creative thinking. In Spring 2013, we deployed Computational Creativity Exercises (CCE) designed to engage creative competencies (Surrounding, Capturing, Challenging and Broadening) in an introductory CSI course for engineering students. We compared this CCE implementation semester (80 students, 95% completing 3 or 4 CCEs) to the Fall 2013 semester of the same course (55 students) without CCEs. CCE implementation students had significantly higher scores on a CS concepts and skills knowledge test (F(1, 132) = 7.72, p < 01, partial Eta2 = .055; M=7.47 to M=6.13; 13 items) and significantly higher self-efficacy for applying CS knowledge in their field (F(1, 153) = 12.22, p < .01, partial Eta2 = .074; M=70.64 to M=61.47; 100-point scale). CCE implementation students had significantly higher study time (t(1, 136) = 2.08, p = .04; M=3.88 to M=3.29; 7-point scale) and significantly lower lack of regulation, which measures difficulties with studying (t(1, 136) = 2.82, p = .006; M=2.80 to M=3.21; 5-point scale).

The Effect on Computational Thinking Using SRA-Programming: Anticipating Changes in a Dynamic Problem Environment,N. Fanchamps; L. Slangen; M. Specht; P. Hennissen,2022,"This article illustrates that the task design and problem selection are of characteristic influence to evoke sense-reason-act programming (SRA) among primary school pupils when programming robots. Research shows that the task design influences the development of computational thinking (CT). The literature provides evidence that the context, the problem space, and the representation of the problem to apply SRA-programming require the programming task to be embedded in a dynamic context in which a programmable robot must use sensory information to anticipate changes in the environment. In order to ascertain whether the problem space and the task design influence the evocation of SRA-thinking, this article uses a research design comparing the differences between two programming conditions (static/dynamic). In these conditions, pupils use Lego EV-3 robots and Mindstorms software to solve programming problems. As a post-measurement, a Lego challenge is applied. In this article, it is shown that the integration of a dynamic task design to solve a programming problem is essential for a deeper understanding of CT skills. Furthermore, when pupils can immediately test the consequences of their program in a dynamic environment and, thus, the learning environment provides an appropriate problem, they gain a deeper understanding of the added value of sensors and will be better able to reason about complex problems. It is found that programming in a dynamic problem environment almost naturally evokes SRA-thinking, as opposed to programming in a static environment. The influence of SRA-programming as demonstrated identifies characteristics of CT.",10.1109/TLT.2022.3162895,IEEE,1.0,IEEE,Computational thinking (CT);dynamic environments;robotics;sense-reason-act (SRA)-thinking;tangible output,IEEE Journals,Mexico,Journal of Machine Learning Research

Exploring the Impact of the Learning Sequence of Computational Thinking and Programming on Learning Outcomes,C. -H. Lai; C. -H. Hsieh,2023,"The primary objective of this research was to investigate effective learning sequences starting with computational thinking, programming, or both. We experimented with and analyzed the learning sequence of students from the Department of Computer Engineering, Information Management, and Mechanical Engineering. The findings indicated that the students of the Department of Computer Engineering possessed prior experiences in programming or computational thinking. Their learning sequences limitedly impacted learning outcomes. Conversely, for the students of the Department of Information Management, learning computational thinking before programming did not result in better learning outcomes, emphasizing the need for coherence in courses. The students of the Department of Mechanical Engineering showed the practical value of computational thinking in non-IT disciplines, particularly in using specialized software such as MATLAB. For students with foundational knowledge, the learning sequence between learning computational thinking and programming was less significant. However, for beginners or those from non-IT backgrounds, effective learning required the coherence and integration of courses. Thus, it is required to maintain cross-course coherence and establish links between computational thinking and programming skills to offer a more in-depth learning experience.",10.1109/SSIM59263.2023.10469197,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,computational thinking;programming;learning sequence;course coherence;interdisciplinary application,IEEE Conferences,France,Nature Communications

However it is important to go deeper and understand how computational thinking activities fosters the cognitive development of the young, especially if we want them to have “a significant advantage in problem solving”, becoming innovative thinkers [1]. To be innovative it is necessary that a person use sophisticated cognitive structures to reason over abstractions and deal with hypothesis. These are the characteristics of the formal operational thinking [2]. Therefore, this paper is about the use of formal thinking on computational thinking activities over a digital fabrication project developed in a Brazilian makerspace (POALab FabLab).

A cognitive model of human thinking,C. Guangzuo; Wei Xuefeng; Lili Wang Boling,2011,"This paper, based on findings in brain organization and cognitive neuroscience, proposed a more low-level and plausible architecture of human cognition, called CAUT, which can demonstrate the diagram and mechanism of human thinking. Comparing with existing models, three changes are made: (1) a pathway called inner loop is added from motor controller to thalamus; (2) a memory controller is added in front of long-term declarative memory, which can judge whether the memory operation is retrieval or not; (3) two new modules, Active Object buffer (AO) and Active Action buffer, are separated out of the general working memory model. With CAUT architecture, a dynamic cognitive model is put out with which typical thinking processes can be interpreted and described more precisely. Problem solving are demonstrated with this model, and two typical problems, decision problem and search problem, are interpreted. Experiments with ACT-R indicate that CAUT is consistent with ACT-R in functional level, and the description can be easily transformed into ACT-R model, and CAUT architecture can be taken as a meta-description and design tool to construct cognitive model. Experiments with ACT-R also indicate the effectiveness of CAUT architecture.",10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022208,IEEE,2.0,IEEE,Cognitive architecture;Cognitive model;Human thinking,IEEE Conferences,Canada,Journal of Computer Science
Assessing Self-Efficacy Method for Enhancing Computational Thinking in Educational Game Environment,R. Nobnop; N. Chondamrongkul; P. Temdee,2024,"Self-efficacy is critical for improving computational thinking in gaming. However, conventional assessment methods like questionnaires can produce disengaged responses or require additional work to understand the questions and have limitations in the assessment of dynamic self-efficacy. To address this challenge, this study proposes a method using in-game features to assess self-efficacy, which can change over the playtime. The employed in-game feature is the Planning Stage, in which learners strategize and prepare their approach before engaging with challenges. We collect data on the time spent in this stage, which is newly proposed in this study. The experiment was conducted with twenty-five students in the Multimedia Technology and Animation Major playing Tenacity-P to accomplish tasks from a computer programming course. To validate the method, we compared self-efficacy results from the game-based approach with those from conventional questionnaires. The findings highlight the need for strategic planning in managing difficult tasks. As challenges increased, performance measures varied more, underscoring the importance of strong problem-solving skills. Efficient strategic planning directly improved self-efficacy, as participants with better planning skills maintained higher self-efficacy despite increasing task difficulty.",10.1109/TIMES-iCON61890.2024.10630739,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Computational Thinking;Educational game;Game features;Self-efficacy,IEEE Conferences,Australia,Journal of Machine Learning Research

Can computational thinking reduce marginalization in the future Internet?,P. Wentworth,2010,"Maths is presently regarded as the key driver that underpins Science, Education and Technology (SET) skills. In spite of significant studies, investment and efforts, math skills and widespread enthusiasm for SET remain elusive. In South Africa's disadvantaged communities, poor quality maths teaching and poor maths performance, both legacies of past political engineering, further fuel marginalization. Computational thinking is a new characterization of some specific procedural thinking, abstraction, problem solving and organizational skills that are finding their way from computer science programs into other fields. The paper describes our refocus of content in BingBee, a SET skill-building kiosk project targeting disadvantaged communities. As we shift to emphasize computational thinking more explicitly, we speculate that these skills could complement, and perhaps eventually displace, some elements of maths as the dominant driver of SET. The confluence of better tools, open service interfaces, and the rapid spread of handsets and devices into marginalized communities is an opportunity to build more widespread computational thinking skills. This could in turn facilitate a future Internet which is more inclusive, and in which users are able to create their own services.",,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Computational thinking;problem solving;abstraction;cognitive skills;marginalized communities,IEEE Conferences,Brazil,Journal of Machine Learning Research

An Empirical Study on Designing STEM+AI Teaching to Cultivate Primary School Students' Computational Thinking Perspective and Identity,X. Li; H. Xiang; M. Zhao; X. Zhou; J. Huang,2024,"With the development of the era of artificial intelligence(AI), China has put forward the cultivation of computational thinking(CT) in the compulsory education curriculum standard. CT includes three dimensions: CT concept, CT practice, and CT perspective. As a part of CT, the development of the CT perspective can promote the growth of students ‘ connection ability, questioning ability, and expression ability. CT perspective promotes the formation of computational identity through the internalization of concepts. At present, there are relatively few studies on the CT perspective. Based on this, this study proposes a design-based STEM + AI teaching model, aiming to create a combination of artificial intelligence and interdisciplinary to cultivate pupils ‘ CT perspective and form their computational identity. In this study, a single group of pre-test and post-test experiments were conducted to test the CT perspective and computational identity of students in the third grade of a primary school in Wuhan. The research shows that the design-based STEM + AI teaching has significantly improved the expression ability and questioning ability of primary school students in the CT perspective, as well as the correlation ability, participation ability, realization ability, and goal-setting ability in the computational identity.

By teaching and learning subjects independently, students are limited to subject-oriented problems, which are not in reality. To address these flaws, integrating knowledge across disciplines becomes significantly necessary. In the past years, STEM has been accepted as one of the effective strategies to bridge the difference in nature of each field to construct more practical projects and innovations. Moreover, the educational robot can be employed as a learning tool in that strategy since it not only provides challenging learning missions but also promotes computational thinking for the students. Therefore, this research study proposed STEM learning activities on three-day workshop to lay out the foundation to the high-school science-and-technology students who are becoming the engineering students.

Cultivating Computational Thinking through Game-Based Learning,K. Adam; R. Lightfoot; M. Chowdhury; J. Phillip Donaldson,2023,"Game-based learning (GBL) can motivate learners and enable them to engage in their learning experience. Additionally, the popularity of GBL has grown in computer science and programming courses, where it can be used to develop computational thinking (CT) skills. CT is critical thinking used to apply fundamental concepts and reasoning derived from computing and computer science. Research has shown that digital GBL can improve critical thinking skills and help learners understand programming concepts, structures, and problem-solving strategies. Despite the popularity of digital GBL, analog card games and bingo games are still valuable and effective tools for learning. However, most studies on GBL that aim to train critical thinking skills have focused on digital approaches. This indicates a gap in the body of knowledge because few studies have explored the effectiveness of analog games for developing CT skills through GBL. The theoretical framework of this study is grounded in two learning theories. Constructivist theory frames learning as the construction of knowledge through a process of action, reflection, and construction. Constructionist learning theory calls for construction of artifacts, learner agency, authentic purpose, or authentic audience during the process. To investigate the design of GBL for developing CT skills and to generate discourse for its widespread adoption, the current study implemented design-based research (DBR) in an undergraduate computer science course for non-computer science majors. By addressing the gap in the literature on GBL for CT skill development, the study aimed to investigate complex learner experiences, including learner struggles and successes, alignment with learning theory principles, and design moves for future iterations of the project. The research question posed is: how can we optimize CT learning through GBL, based on learner experiences and learning theories? Prior to this study, the instructor used GBL in which learners played an analog, three-dimensional tic-tac-toe game with ping pong balls and then wrote a computer program that simulated that game. We chose to conduct DBR to strengthen the learning associated with this activity. DBR uses iterative designs to develop knowledge that improves educational practices. In the spring of 2023, we assessed the extent to which the non-digital game and programming the simulated game enhanced learners' CT skills by analyzing their experiences with CT. This involved collecting and analyzing learner surveys to gain insight into their learning experiences. Using network analysis and betweenness centrality measures, the data will be analyzed to identify learner struggles and successes. The results are expected to be available by August 2023. The contributions of this study include identifying effective design principles for GBL, optimizing CT learning, and generating discourse for the widespread adoption of GBL in computer science education.",10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10342931,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,game-based learning (GBL);design-based research (DBR);computational thinking;computer science;undergraduate;constructivist;constructionist;analog,IEEE Conferences,China,Journal of Machine Learning Research

A Digital Game-Based Model for Assessing Computational Thinking Skills,X. Yi; F. Liu; Z.

The uniqueness of Computational thinking,P. Larsson; M. -V. Apiola; M. -J. Laakso,2019,"The concept of computational thinking is timely. It is widely agreed that in order to benefit and thrive in a digital world, more than digital literacy is required. Computational thinking promises understanding of information technology and its utilization without necessarily knowing how to write code. According to many authors, skills in computational thinking include the ability to evaluate and design solutions to problems. However, the vision for computational thinking, laid out by a number of scholars, is even bigger than this. It proposes that thinking habits from computer science are beneficial for any kind of problem solving and that those thinking habits form a central part of modern sciences. It might be that components of computational thinking are indeed useful in problem solving and that they play an important part in other sciences. However, computer science combines three types of thinking traditions: theoretical (mathematical) tradition, engineering tradition and scientific tradition, and it is important to differentiate between what is an aspect in one or more of these traditions and what is unique for computer science.

In this study, a new pedagogical method named PBL-VP combining the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and the visual programming Blockly was applied to Computer Basis. This paper described a classical example about problem solving to explain the teaching process of the PBL-VP in detail. The process of problem solving was divided into several operable steps to gradually guide students to analyze problems, provide solutions and establish scientific logic thinking. Blockly was introduced to obscure the grammar of programming language and implement the algorithm visually. Finally, we evaluated the effectiveness of the PBL-VP teaching method on student learning by a contrast test. The empirical results proved that students in the class with PBL-VP earned higher final grades and the teaching method we proposed played a positive role in computer general education.",10.1109/ICCSE.2019.8845503,IEEE,7.0,IEEE,Problem-Based Learning (PBL);visual programing;computational thinking;problem solving;computer general education,IEEE Conferences,USA,PLOS ONE

"Complex Problem Solving as a Construct of Inquiry, Computational Thinking and Mathematical Problem Solving",M. Pedaste; T. Palts; K. Kori; M. Sõrmus; Ä. Leijen,2019,"Complex problem solving is one of the key skills for future jobs, but it has not been clearly operationalized. We hypothesized that it is a construct of inquiry, computational thinking, and mathematical problem solving. The hypothesis was empirically tested by administering tests to 261 high school students for assessing three inquiry skills, two dimensions of computational thinking and five mathematical problem solving skills. Confirmatory factor analysis showed a three factor model of inquiry skills and two factor model of computational thinking skills to have a good fit. Mathematical problem solving skills were characterized with a two factor model. These factors were combined in a higher-order factor model into one construct that could be defined as a complex problem solving skill.",10.1109/ICALT.2019.00071,IEEE,3.0,IEEE,problem solving;inquiry-based learning;computational thinking;mathematical problem solving;theory building,IEEE Conferences,Australia,Journal of Machine Learning Research
Computational Thinking Test for Beginners: Design and Content Validation,M. Zapata-Cáceres; E. Martín-Barroso; M. Román-González,2020,"Computational Thinking (CT) is a fundamental skill that is not only confined to computer scientists’ activities but can be widely applied in daily life and is required in order to adapt to the future and, therefore, should be taught at early ages. Within this framework, assessing CT is an indispensable part to consider in order to introduce CT in the school curricula. Nevertheless, efforts involving the formal assessment of computational thinking has primarily focused on middle school grades and above; and are mostly based on the analysis of projects in specific programming environments. A Beginners Computational Thinking Test (BCTt), aimed at early ages, and based on the Computational Thinking Test [1], has been designed including several improvements; submitted to a content validation process through expert´s judgement procedure; and administered to Primary School students. The BCTt design is considered adequate by experts and results show a high reliability for the assessment of CT in Primary School, particularly in first educational stages.",10.1109/EDUCON45650.2020.9125368,IEEE,28.0,IEEE,Beginners Computational Thinking Test;Computational Thinking;Computer Science Education;Primary Education;Assessment;Programming;Early Childhood Education,IEEE Conferences,Argentina,Computers & Education

Teaching Computational Thinking by Playing Games and Building Robots,J. F. Roscoe; S. Fearn; E. Posey,2014,"Computing in schools has gained momentum in the last two years resulting in GCSEs in Computing and teachers looking to up skill from Digital Literacy (ICT). For many students the subject of computer science concerns software code but writing code can be challenging, due to specific requirements on syntax and spelling with new ways of thinking required. Not only do many undergraduate students lack these ways of thinking, but there is a general misrepresentation of computing in education. Were computing taught as a more serious subject like science and mathematics, public understanding of the complexities of computer systems would increase, enabling those not directly involved with IT make better informed decisions and avoid incidents such as over budget and underperforming systems. We present our exploration into teaching a variety of computing skills, most significantly ""computational thinking"", to secondary-school age children through three very different engagements. First, we discuss Print craft, in which participants learn about computer-aided design and additive manufacturing by designing and building a miniature world from scratch using the popular open-world game Mine craft and 3D printers. Second, we look at how students can get a new perspective on familiar technology with a workshop using App Inventor, a graphical Android programming environment. Finally, we look at an ongoing after school robotics club where participants face a number of challenges of their own making as they design and create a variety of robots using a number of common tools such as Scratch and Arduino.",10.1109/iTAG.2014.15,IEEE,17.0,IEEE,computational thinking;e ducation;games;technology;STEM,IEEE Conferences,Canada,ACM Transactions on Graphics

TechCheck-K: A Measure of Computational Thinking for Kindergarten Children,E. Relkin; M. Bers,2021,"In this pilot study we created and evaluated a new version of the TechCheck Computational Thinking (CT) assessment designed specifically for kindergarten students. The original version of TechCheck was validated in first and second graders and consists of 15 multiple choice unplugged challenges drawn from six CT domains. The kindergarten version, called TechCheck-K, consists of similar unplugged challenges but reduces the number of response choices from four to three and uses exclusively non-verbal material in the responses to accommodate younger, pre-literate children. We administered TechCheck-K to N =89 kindergarten students from four schools, including 45 boys and 44 girls with no coding experience. Participants completed the assessment in an average of 23.43 minutes. TechCheck-K scores were normally distributed (M =8.26, SD =2.33). Mean scores were numerically higher in boys (M =8.71, SD = 2.69) than girls (M =8.05, SD = 2.07). The difference between genders was not significant. The pattern of correct responses to the 15 TechCheck-K items correlated (r =.76) with the pattern observed in first and second graders on the original TechCheck, providing evidence that comparable CT constructs are measured by the two versions of the instrument.

Other issues raised by research concern the decontextualization of computing education from the actual lives of students which causes problems for students under represented in the fields of computing and engineering, such as female students. To tackle this problem, paper aimed to develop (STEM-Computational Thinking (CT)-Computing) scenarios related to students' actual lives and their local communities in order to help female students to develop STEM(Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) competences, when core disciplinary ideas and cross-cutting concepts are infused in the scenarios. All scenarios were implemented using the didactic model of inquiry teaching and learning and the engineering design thinking instruction strategy using physical computing activities. A validated questionnaire for self-efficacy and CT practices was applied before and after the intervention to female prospective engineering school teachers studying at Higher Education Institutes in Greece.

Scaffolding Computational Thinking With ChatGPT,J. Liao; L. Zhong; L. Zhe; H. Xu; M. Liu; T. Xie,2024,"ChatGPT has received considerable attention in education, particularly in programming education because of its capabilities in automated code generation and program repairing and scoring. However, few empirical studies have investigated the use of ChatGPT to customize a learning system for scaffolding students’ computational thinking. Therefore, this article proposes an intelligent programming scaffolding system using ChatGPT following the theoretical framework of computational thinking and scaffolding. A mixed-method study was conducted to investigate the affordance of the scaffolding system using ChatGPT, and the findings show that most students had positive attitudes about the proposed system, and it was effective in improving their computational thinking generally but not their problem-solving skills. Therefore, more scaffolding strategies are discussed with the aim of improving student computational thinking, especially regarding problem-solving skills. The findings of this study are expected to guide future designs of generative artificial intelligence tools embedded in intelligent learning systems to foster students’ computational thinking and programming learning.",10.1109/TLT.2024.3392896,IEEE,1.0,IEEE,Artificial-intelligence-generated content (AIGC);ChatGPT;computational thinking (CT);scaffolding,IEEE Journals,France,Science Advances

Developing Computational Thinking Skills With Algorithm-Driven Spreadsheeting,M. Csernoch; P. Biró; J. Máth,2021,"The paper presents the details of a four-year project to test the effectiveness of teaching spreadsheeting with spreadsheet programming, instead of the traditional, widely accepted surface approach methods. The novel method applied in the project, entitled Sprego (Spreadsheet Lego), is a concept-based problem-solving approach adapted from the didactics of other sciences and computer programming. In the experimental group contextualized, real-world programming problems are presented in a spreadsheet environment. A semi-unplugged data-driven analysis is carried out based on each problem, which is followed by the building of a feasible algorithm, expressed by natural language expressions. The coding is completed in the following step by applying a limited number of spreadsheet (Sprego) functions, multilevel, and array formulas. The final steps of the process are discussion and debugging. On the other hand, classical, tool-centered approaches are applied in the control groups. Our research reveals that the traditional surface approach methods for teaching spreadsheeting do not provide long lasting, reliable knowledge which would provide students and end-users with effective problem-solving strategies, while Sprego does. Beyond this finding, the project proves that Sprego supports schema construction and extended abstraction, which is one of the major hiatus points of traditional surface navigation methods. The project also reveals that developing computational thinking skills should not be downgraded, and the misconceptions of self-taught end-users and user-friendly applications should be reconsidered, especially their application in educational environments. Gaining effective computer problem-solving skills and knowledge-transfer abilities is not magic, but a time-consuming process which requires consciously developed and effective methods, and teachers who accept the incremental nature of the sciences.",10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3126757,IEEE,4.0,IEEE,Algorithm-driven spreadsheeting;long lasting knowledge;schema construction;cognitive load;end-user computing;computational thinking,IEEE Journals,Germany,Science Advances

Development of Computational Thinking in High School Students: A Case Study in Chile,F. González; C. López; C. Castro,2018,"Most efforts to incorporate computational thinking in K-12 education use visual tools (e.g., Scratch) and focus on students in their first grades. Fewer projects investigate the development of computational thinking in students in the last years of school, who usually have not had early formal preparation to acquire these skills. This study provides evidence of the effectiveness of teaching C++ (a low-level programming language) to develop computational thinking in high school students in Chile. By applying a test before and after a voluntary C++ workshop, the results reveal a significant improvement in computational thinking after the workshop. However, we observe that there was a tendency to drop out of the workshop among students with lower levels of initial computational thinking. Besides, tenth-grade students obtained lower final scores than eleventh and twelfth-grade students. These results indicate that teaching a low-level programming language is useful, but it has high entry-barriers.",10.1109/SCCC.2018.8705239,IEEE,3.0,IEEE,Computational Thinking Test;C++;Programming in High School,IEEE Conferences,Canada,Nature Communications

Towards the Automatic Recognition of Computational Thinking for Adaptive Visual Language Learning,K. H. Koh; A. Basawapatna; V. Bennett; A. Repenning,2010,"Visual programming languages can be used to make computer science more accessible to a broad range of students. The evaluative focus of current research in the area of visual languages for educational purposes primarily aims to better understand motivational benefits as compared to traditional programming languages. Often these visual languages claim to teach students computational thinking concepts; however, although the evaluations show that students may exhibit more enthusiasm, it is not always clear what computational thinking concepts students have actually learned. In this paper we attempt to develop a visual semantic evaluation tool for student-created games and simulations that goes towards depicting the computational thinking concepts implemented by the students. Through semantically analyzing a given student's created projects over time, this visual evaluation tool, called the Computational Thinking Pattern (CTP) graph, can possibly indicate the existence of computational thinking transfer from games to science simulations.",10.1109/VLHCC.2010.17,IEEE,51.0,IEEE,Computational Thinking;Visual Language Programming;Knowledge Transfer,IEEE Conferences,Canada,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
Mapping computational thinking mindsets between educational levels with cognitive network science,M. Stella; A. Kapuza; C. Cramer; S. Uzzo; V. Latora,2021,"A significant aspect of computational thinking is as a way of reasoning about the world in terms of data. This mindset channels number-crunching toward an ambition to discover knowledge through logic, models and simulations. Here we show how computational cognitive science can be used to reconstruct and analyse the structure of computational thinking mindsets (forma mentis in Latin) through complex networks. As a case study, we investigate cognitive networks tied to key concepts of computational thinking provided by (i) 159 high school students enrolled in a science curriculum and (ii) 59 researchers in complex systems and simulations. Researchers' reconstructed knowledge highlighted a positive mindset about scientific modelling, semantically framing data and simulations as ways of discovering nature. Students correctly identified different aspects of logic reasoning but perceived ‘computation’ as a distressing, anxiety-eliciting task, framed with math jargon and lacking links to real-world discovery. Students' mindsets around ‘data’, ‘model’ and ‘simulations’ critically revealed no awareness of numerical modelling as a way for understanding the world. Our findings provide evidence of a crippled computational thinking mindset in students, who acquire mathematical skills that are not channelled toward real-world discovery through coding. This unlinked knowledge ends up being perceived as distressing number-crunching expertise with no relevant outcome. The virtuous mindset of researchers reported here indicates that computational thinking can be restored by training students specifically in coding, modelling and simulations in relation to discovering nature. Our approach opens innovative ways for quantifying computational thinking and enhancing its development through mindset reconstruction.",10.1093/comnet/cnab020,OUP,0.0,IEEE,computational thinking;cognitive network science;mindset reconstruction;education,OUP Journals,India,Journal of Machine Learning Research

Instilling Computational Thinking in Undergraduate Students Across Multiple Disciplines through an Adaptive Gamified e-Learning Platform,A. K. Ng; I. Atmosukarto; J. K. Lee Teo; A. B. Amran,2023,"This full paper presents the instillation of computational thinking (CT) in undergraduate students across multiple disciplines through an adaptive gamified e-learning platform. In today’s fast-paced digital age, possessing CT abilities is essential for effective critical thinking and problem-solving across various fields. To cultivate CT proficiency in students from diverse disciplines, we designed an innovative adaptive gamified e-learning platform called Computational Thinking Quest (CTQ). The eight key features of CTQ are (1) interactive storyline with customizable avatars, mini-games, and questions; (2) performance profiler; (3) comprehensive question bank with questions at three difficulty levels; (4) feedback and answer to each question; (5) additional learning resources via hyperlinks; (6) badges and leaderboard; (7) progress saving feature; and (8) integrated online feedback survey. The CTQ was introduced to recently enrolled first-year undergraduate students across all five discipline clusters at Singapore Institute of Technology. The learning performance and feedback of 135 students were gathered and examined. The student population comprised 33 Business, Communication and Design (BCD); 48 Health and Social Science (HSS); and 54 Infocomm Technology (ICT) undergraduates. Statistical results from the paired Student’s t-test reveal significant differences (p < 0.05) (i) between the pre-test and post-test scores for HSS, ICT, and all students combined; (ii) between the pre-test duration and post-test duration for all three clusters and all students combined; (iii) between the self-assessed knowledge score before CTQ and after completing CTQ for all three clusters and all students combined. Moreover, majority of the students commented that the CTQ generates interest in CT, is an engaging learning platform with enriching educational content, and has motivated their independent learning. Lastly, CTQ functions as an online preparatory course aimed at reducing the diversity in academic backgrounds and varying levels of prior knowledge of computer programming languages among students.

Guzmán,2022,"In the present Research-to-practice Full-paper, the learning, reasoning, and problem-solving processes, in engineering students, have been analyzed from different approaches, one of them is the computational thinking process, where most of the activities must be performed as a computer does and the reasoning is developed with the well-oriented activities realized by them. In many of the engineering career programs, the Physics courses are fundamental, and because of the diversity in contexts, they have not been seen as a subject where students can develop the computational thinking process. Present work describes an empirical study based on the learning of the rigid body concept in physics, with the use of spreadsheets as an electronic tool for promoting the learning with the programming of all the dynamical system, describing the evolution, generating, and analyzing graphics, and explaining the physical phenomena with a high comprehension and transfer of knowledge. At the end, students identified where the concept can be applied in their professional context with the use of a simulation. The learning sequence was implemented in three sessions of 1.5 hours each one, two diagnostic tests were applied, one for identifying the previous knowledge and use of electronic spreadsheets, the second one used as a pretest and post-test, it was focused on the main concepts of the rigid body system, like forces, kinematics, and circular movement. The sequence was implemented with N = 77, students. Session 1, started with the introduction of electronic spreadsheets for their use in science and engineering, some examples in Physics and Mathematics were described with their respect feedbacking for students. For session two, the rigid body concept was described with the support of electronic spreadsheets, all the dynamics, equations, plotting of the results and the relationships of all variables were described; for reinforcing the concept learned, students were asked to solve two more similar exercises with the use of the spreadsheets as homework, and finally they were asked to record, in groups of three students, a video with the solution of the problem assigned. In the video, they must present the problem description, equations and dynamics involved in the solutions and explaining all the programming steps needed to perform the solution in an electronic spreadsheet with its graphical representation and interpretation of the variables, and a description of implications in the changing values of the variables in the mathematical model. At the end of the sequence, in session three, a virtual simulation related to their professional context was used for the reinforcement of all the concepts learned. For analyzing the impact in their learning process, the Normalized Conceptual Gain was used in the pre-test and post-test, results showed a g = 0.85, which represents a high learning and normalized conceptual gain.

Then, the synthesis results were integrated into the development of computational thinking through gamification and programming knowledge to improve the efficacy of computational learning. The process commenced with an analysis of the learners' needs obtained through the questionnaires concerning computational thinking. Data analysis illuminated the learners' levels of computational thinking as well as a fundamental understanding of what the learners need to be taught or what areas of skills each learner. With regards to this, conventional teaching approaches may not serve best to transmit the relevant knowledge which may subsequently induce unfavorable attitudes toward computational thinking. With the data elicited through the need assessment, instructors will have a clear direction as to how the pedagogical process should be designed to directly address the needs in each of the computational thinking components. In general, each component of them is rather complex, so the researcher incorporated gamification theory-based learning defined by its enjoyable game mechanisms and challenging nature which makes the coding lesson fun with block programming enabling learners to proficiently grasp the concept of computational thinking.",10.1109/SEA-STEM53614.2021.9668107,IEEE,1.0,IEEE,computational thinking;need assessment;gamification;computational thinking with coding,IEEE Conferences,Japan,Nature Communications

Computational Thinking for STEM Teacher Leadership Training at Louisiana State University,F. Alegre; J. Moreno; T. Dawson; E. E. Tanjong; D. H. Kirshner,2020,"We developed and piloted a new course titled Computer Science Teaching Methods (CSM) in the fall semester of 2019. This course was based on materials developed from a previous program that trained high school teachers in computational thinking and programming through LSU's Cain Center. Pedagogical content knowledge informed the design of this course. Also, data gathered from teacher and instructor interaction at multiple sites during the summer STEM professional development program contributed to the courses' design. The CS Methods course targeted undergraduate computer science majors who were considering a career in teaching or who were interested in CS pedagogy. We encountered several challenges recruiting and retaining students and found that computer science students attracted to teaching careers do not fall into the stereotype of most computer science majors. Participation of women was higher than the average undergraduate CS courses. A disconnect appeared between the pedagogical practices promoted for teaching computing at the high school level and those being practiced at the college level. After learning about the 5E pedagogical model for teaching computing, students expressed interest in the potential of using more student-centered instruction, not only for high school instruction, but also for their own college courses. An area of disconnect also emerged in the programming formats, as all the students were comfortable with Java but all were unfamiliar with popular block-based programming platforms, such as Scratch.

A Model of Computational Creativity based on Engram Cell Theory,Q. Li; B. Li,2023,"Artificial Intelligence technology has made remarkable progress in machine learning, but it is still in its infancy in creative thinking or computational creativity. In 2018, Yang and Li proposed that the physiological basis for the formation of memories and concepts in the human brain is engram cells (interneuron), and creative thinking is the process of forming new engram cells to connect previously seemingly unrelated concepts. During this process, association and prediction play a key role. In this study, a computational model based on engram cell theory was coded in Python to mimic the process of creative thinking. The validity of the model was tested by simulating the phenomenon of language generation and summarizing the artificial food-set regularity in the plus maze. The results show that, given 29 initial words and certain grammatical rules, the language generation program generates 25,405 sentences after 130,000 calculations, and these generated sentences can be combined into various short paragraphs. After 50 times of training in the cross maze puzzle solving program, the model can master 100% of the rules of artificial food settings. In conclusion, a computational model of creative thinking based on engram cell theory can creatively and automatically generate sentences and paragraphs, and can learn and summarize laws to solve simple puzzles. We plan to further use this model to address complex real-world problems, such as the study of cancer therapeutic targets",10.1109/CAI54212.2023.00121,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,creative thinking;engram cell theory;computational model;language generation;puzzle solution,IEEE Conferences,France,Computers & Education
Teaching computational thinking to non-computing majors using spreadsheet functions,K. -C. Yeh; Y. Xie; F. Ke,2011,"Recently, higher education has seen an increasing emphasis on the prominent role of computational thinking in all disciplines. Computational thinking is advocated as not only a fundamental skill or concept in computer science but also a core competency for all disciplines. Teaching students in non-computer science majors computing thinking is challenging because students do not have experts' mental models. This study investigates the knowledge gap that non-computing major college students (n=126) possess about computational thinking in an introductory MS Excel course by measuring their performance using spreadsheet functions in three categories: recall, application, and problem solving. The empirical result, analyzed using ANOVA, shows that students can recall the meaning of those functions but seem to have trouble using them correctly and precisely (cued or uncued). Students' test results suggest the following issues: (1) problems with understanding the data type, (2) failure in translating problems to productive representations using spreadsheet functions, and (3) inadequate stipulation of the computational representations in precise forms. Addressing these problems early and explicitly in future classes could improve the education of computational thinking and alleviate difficulties students may experience in using computational thinking in learning and problem solving.",10.1109/FIE.2011.6142980,IEEE,9.0,IEEE,Computational Thinking;Computer Science Education;Spreadsheet Functions;Problem Solving,IEEE Conferences,France,Journal of Machine Learning Research

Facilitating Students’ Abstract and Computational Thinking Skills Using Virtual Reality,X. Wang; D. Saito; H. Washizaki; Y. Fukazawa,2023,"As Virtual reality (VR) devices become more widespread, they are being recognized as efficient teaching tools for many subjects. In the 21st century, learners are expected to master important skills, which are difficult to teach in conventional lectures, such as computational thinking, critical thinking, creativity, and abstract reasoning. [1] Therefore, computer science or information technology courses often limit the discussion of recursion to calculating a factorial or a Fibonacci number, even though recursion is presented as an academic-type oddity in most cases. [2] To elucidate how VR can improve students’ computational thinking skills and abstract thinking associated with solving problems that require recursive algorithms, this paper examines the use of VR in computer science education to teach the abstract concept of recursion. The results of learners using VR Tower of Hanoi software are compared to those using the conventional Hanoi puzzle. Most learners show an improved understanding after experiencing the gameplay in the VR software, and some demonstrate a better understanding of recursion.

Correlation analysis was conducted to examine their relationships. We analyzed their relationships using correlation analysis and generalized structural equation modeling (GSEM). The results of the correlation analysis showed both weak positive correlations and weak negative correlations between the immersion factor and CT skills, indicating the importance of striking an appropriate balance between increasing player immersion and improving CT skills during game design. The results of generalized structural equation modeling revealed that while increased presence promoted creativity, high immersion hurt algorithmic thinking, flow state hurt problem-solving skills, and the factor of game immersion had no significant effect on cooperative skills. These findings suggest the importance of considering game design elements that target specific cognitive abilities in designing game-based health promotion and treatment programs. For example, immersive game design may effectively enhance creativity and problem-solving skills.

Computational Thinking Growth During a First-Year Engineering Course,N. V. Mendoza Diaz; R. Meier; D. A. Trytten; S. Yoon Yoon,2020,"This full research-track paper demonstrates growth in computational thinking in a cohort of engineering students completing their first course in engineering at a large Southwestern university in the United States. Computational thinking has been acknowledged as a key aspect of engineering education and an intrinsic part of multiple ABET outcomes. However, computing is an area where some students have more privileges (e.g. access and exposure to meaningful use of computers) than others. Integrating computing into engineering, especially early in the curriculum, may exacerbate existing experiential disadvantages students from excluded social identities experience. Most introductory engineering programs have a component of programming and/or computational thinking. A comprehensive literature review showed that no existing computational thinking framework fully met the needs of students and professors in engineering and computer science. As a result, this team created the Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic (ECTD). This diagnostic was assessed and improved during the 2019-2020 academic year. Data was collected from a cohort in a first-year engineering course that included topics in mathematics, engineering problem solving, and computation. Pre- and post-test data analysis with 62 participants documents statistically significant student growth in computational thinking in this course. Significant differences were not found by gender or a limited racially-based analysis. This diagnostic is of interest and relevance to all institutions providing engineering and computing programs. The short-term impact of this research includes an innovative approach to gauge student abilities in computational thinking early in a course in order to add appropriate intervention activities into lesson plans.

The purpose of this work-in-progress (WIP) is to identify and compare the existing definitions of CT proposed by various members of the education or research community, and ultimately to give educators and researchers suggestions on understanding this concept for particular purposes or situations. We conducted a systematic review of the definitions of CT from the source of academic articles and categorized the definitions based on their approaches, dimensions, and contexts. Forty-one unique and original concepts were extracted from the search. Results indicate that the existing definitions of CT were mostly formulated 1) with a prototype approach, 2) for the generic purpose of use, 3) in the context of K-12 education, 4) based on the subject of Computer Science. These results provide sufficient granularity to allow us to come up with suggestions on how to choose appropriate and pragmatic CT definitions.",10.1109/ISEC52395.2021.9764144,IEEE,2.0,IEEE,Computational Thinking;Algorithmic Thinking;Educational Curriculum;Operational Definition;Systematic review,IEEE Conferences,Germany,Journal of Machine Learning Research
Engineering Human Body for Systematic and Computational Thinking,C. Zhu; J. E. Ahn; L. Cui; R. Hare; Y. Tang,2023,"This Research to Practice Work-in-Progress paper discusses a next-generation learning system for K-12 students to educate them on scientific concepts surrounding the human body. Specifically, our gamified learning system is designed to make learning more fun, engaging, and effective through game and experiment elements that align with science and math learning standards. It will also increase systematic problem-solving and algorithmic reasoning for K-12 students. Since the human body can be thought of as a combination of interacting systems, the game also introduces students to computational thinking by introducing internal body functions. To achieve these goals, this project has two components. First, an educational virtual reality game will be built according to the natural human body structure. During the game process, students will experience the same as the human body functions, travel along the blood circulation, help with the heartbeat, and participate in oxygen exchange. While students are playing the game, our gamified adaptive learning system tracks and controls the student's learning progress. As the AI component collects student data and uses this information, our system adjusts game content and addresses possible learner issues to refine the learning curriculum for a faster and more effective learning experience. Second, a series of hands-on activities will be conducted based on the functions of the human body (e.g., developing an artificial heart and experiencing how the heart works). Through this project, an attractive and efficient next-generation learning system will be developed and used to expose K-12 students to this learning system. The education of students will be accomplished in different dimensions through games and hands-on practice, respectively. Additionally, compared to traditional learning methods, our learning system not only increases students' interest in learning but also makes it more personalized compared to the conventional learning process. Likewise, we will refer to the results of self-efficacy surveys administered to students and teachers separately to test their perceptions of their abilities and the new system.",10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10342946,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Gamification;Educational Software;Learning Technology;Computational Thinking;Systematic Thinking,IEEE Conferences,UK,Science Advances

Exploring Computational Thinking Perspectives in Black Communities with Physiological Computing,M. Lewis; A. Holloman; B. Y. Hernández Cuevas; C. Crawford,2024,"Physiological computing (PC) technology is becoming increasingly popular as wearable hardware improves. However, little is known regarding potential connections between hands-on experience with physiological computing technology and computation thinking perspectives. This is particularly true for black communities. Applications for physiological computing include systems such as wearable technology (e.g., Apple Watch) capable of mapping students' physiological activity to various outputs. The work discussed in this paper presents our initial steps toward filling these gaps. In particular, we share our observations of computational thinking perspectives that emerged while black high school students constructed simple programs driven by near real-time brain wave information.

Use of Augmented Reality for Computational Thinking Stimulation through Virtual,A. M. d. S. Esteves; A. L. M. Santana; R. Lyra,2019,"Studies with augmented reality show that while the technology helps the student learn, it may end up disturbing other points, showing that more research is needed with the use of augmented reality. Also, a topic that is growing within education is Computational Thinking, which says that the thinking like computer scientists is necessary for the 21st century and should be disseminated mainly in schools during basic education. In the face of this, this work created an augmented reality android application that tracks physical tiles and creates 3D maps for the user, also giving a character that can be programmed to walk on this created map, simulating a programming toy. Finally, tests carried out with the application have shown that augmented reality currently has performance problems when multiple targets are used, so, devices with low processing have problems at map tracking. These issues affected the tests with the children, which made it difficult for them to track the map like they wanted, but they still liked the app even after it. That shows that the acceptance of the technology by the children is good, which can help developing Computational Thinking, but the technology limitation is still a problem. These obstacles while currently hindering the use of augmented reality in education may in the future be irrelevant due to the constant advancement of technology. This paper's main contribution is showing one possibility of using AR with Computational Thinking and what needs to evolve for it to be used by the usable by the children.",10.1109/SVR.2019.00031,IEEE,5.0,IEEE,Computational Thinking;Augmented Reality;Technology in Education,IEEE Conferences,India,PLOS ONE

Computational Notebooks in a Finite Element Analysis Course: Engineering Students' Reflections on the Value and Challenges of Computational Approaches,C. Vieira; D. Restrepo; J. L. De La Hoz,2023,"This work-in-progress paper introduces an innovative approach that uses computational notebooks to teach Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate course to aid the understanding of complex phenomena in Mechanics of Materials, and enhance students' computational thinking skills. Research indicates that students, irrespective of their educational level, face difficulties in grasping fundamental concepts in mechanics of materials. These challenges arise from the inherent complexity of concepts like stress, strain, torsion, and buckling, which are difficult to observe, hindering comprehension. Therefore, this work aims to leverage the synergy between mechanics of materials and computational principles to actively engage students in advanced topics such as structural strength, failure of structures, and sensitivity analysis, through the use of computational notebooks. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we first asked students to analyze truss structures using hand calculations following the discrete stiffness method within a Finite Element Analysis framework. Subsequently, we implemented the same method as a simulation tool in a MATLAB Computational Notebook. Finally, we asked the students to reflect on: (1) the value of using computational methods to approach Finite Element Analysis when compared to hand calculations; (2) the difficulties they faced when implementing the activities in the MATLAB Computational Notebook; (3) the support they required to successfully complete these activities; and (4) the effectiveness of the simulation tool in understanding the effect of forces and stress distributions in structures. We anticipate that computational notebooks will provide an ideal platform for sharing lessons and tutorials, enhancing student engagement, and promoting active learning. Students have access to the complete source code, allowing them to develop computational skills.

Moreover, an exploratory case study has been carried out involving 176 primary school students. Results suggest that this environment is suitable as a learning and assessment tool for CT skills in primary school, providing enduring learning, particularly when it engages the collaborative playing mode.

Enhancing Confidence in Using Computational Thinking Skills via Playing a Serious Game: A Case Study to Increase Motivation in Learning Computer Programming,C. Kazimoglu,2020,"Computer Science (CS) is a profession that positively impacts every single area of society without which today's world would come to a complete halt. Yet, there is a consensus that CS has serious conundrums particularly in attracting students, low motivation for learning computer programming and developing computational thinking (CT) skills. New motivational methods are needed to take the attention of students and adapt to their learning patterns as how people learn have changed drastically over the last two decades. To address these issues, video games and video game-based tools are proposed as a primary approach for motivating and supporting students in developing their skills in CT and support their learning of introductory programming. This research is concerned with the capture of statistical evidence on the educational effectiveness of playing a serious game specifically designed to enhance the development of CT skills to facilitate learning introductory computer programming. A total of 190 students were invited to participate in a quasi-experimental pre-post study for the purpose of analyzing the impact of an adhoc game on students' confidence in learning programming constructs and using their skills in CT. All students were studying a CS degree at the time and they were all registered to a first-year computer programming course. 151 out of 190 students successfully completed the study and the findings suggest that a) the intrinsic motivation to learn programming; b) students' perception of their knowledge and their tangible knowledge in key programming constructs (i.e. programming sequence, methods, decision making and loops); and c) students' confidence in using their CT skills were all statistically and significantly improved after playing the game.

A Machine Learning-Based Adaptive Feedback System to Enhance Programming Skill Using Computational Thinking,M. Kaleem; M. A. Hassan; S. K. Khurshid,2024,"The solution of a typical programming task involves algorithmic thinking, pattern recognition, decomposition, and abstraction skills. These skills are basic pillars of Computational thinking (CT) and are essential for a computer programmer. Therefore, a programming teacher needs to take these skills into account for the evaluation of students. Existing methods for improving programming competency don’t consider the Computational Thinking of students and perform grading of students without taking these skills into account. Due to this limitation, deficiencies of these skills in students remain unrevealed, posing difficulties for educators to provide need-oriented feedback. The performance of programming students is thus hindered by a lack of interventions. This study proposes a method to evaluate programming students in terms of CT skill components and group them based on their skill set. In this study, 780 students of object-oriented programming (OOP) class were given programming assignments for assessment of programming competencies. These students were then given small programming tasks requiring different computational thinking skill components for their solutions. A machine learning approach was used to perform grouping of these students based on their scores. Six groups of programming students, each having its own set of skill deficiencies, were identified as a result of clustering. One of the groups had an empty set of skill deficiencies and consisted of students proficient in programming. Each of the other five groups had a non-empty set of skill deficiencies and comprised non-proficient programming students. A group-specific skill development plan was built for the groups having skill deficiencies. It was found that such feedback was very effective and improved the CT skill deficiencies of 82% of students.",10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3391873,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Computational thinking assessment;feedback;K-means clustering;programming,IEEE Journals,USA,PLOS ONE

Problock: A tool for computational thinking development using problem-based learning,J. F. Calderón; J. Ebers,2017,"While in the workplace are highly demanded work-related awareness of computing and information technology, this discipline does not have sufficient and accurate dissemination, especially in schools. New technologies have positioned more as a communication tool than as a means for building innovative products. On the other hand, it has missed the application of own abilities in the area, such as the development of logical reasoning, algorithmic thinking and problem solving, both the school curriculum as well as in instances of informal learning of students. In literature and on the web, there are tools that are accessible by both self-study students to be used as a complement to other activities. However, these tools seek the development of computational thinking itself, and not within a broader framework, which allows to present the computer science as an area of professional development, for example, inserted in a context where should solve problems requiring support programming and algorithms. Problock is proposed as a tool to (1) develop computational thinking, in a context of learning based on addiction problems, (2) disseminate and motivate students for future professional development in higher education in computer science and disciplines related.

DWES: A Dynamic Weighted Evaluation System for Scratch based on Computational Thinking,X. Chai; Y. Sun; H. Luo; M. Guizani,2022,"Scratch is a programming environment, which is widely adopted as the first language to enter the programming world. Since Scratch projects are rich in multimedia resources, it can be time-consuming to judge them by hand, requiring manual execution with the understanding of each project. Auto-judgment tools come into being, they can rapidly evaluate the project in some way. Unfortunately, the existing tools are too rigid and they ignore the diversity of Scratch projects. To address this issue, we propose a new dynamic weighted evaluation system (DWES). First, we define a new computational thinking (CT) evaluation criteria from eight aspects. Second, based on the proposed criteria, we present an analysis tool that automatically assesses the CT skills of the learners’ projects. Third, considering the characteristics of projects, we dynamically adjust the evaluation results according to types, so that a single standard is no longer applied roughly to all. This process is data-driven, we consider the CT performance and scripts of projects. We prove the rationality of the evaluation criteria from the aspect of program complexity. Through the correlation analysis between DWES CT scores and experts’ ratings, we find that compared with Dr. Scratch, the correlation coefficient has increased.",10.1109/TETC.2020.3044588,IEEE,6.0,IEEE,Scratch;computational thinking;evaluation system;dynamic weighted,IEEE Journals,Australia,ACM Transactions on Graphics
A Computational Thinking Assessment Tool on Text- Based Programming,J. Wang; W. Zhang; X. Zeng; P.

However, the current research on CT assessment is mostly single-approach, which is not effective in accurately measuring numerous competencies of CT skills and has the disadvantage of assessment limitation. In order to solve the problem of assessment limitations, this paper defines the content of CT evaluation from the perspective of text-based programming and constructs a multidimensional test method. Different test schemes are selected according to the characteristics of CT skills, and assessment tools are developed by combining the question test, programming test and scale survey, and the assessment tools are used to evaluate and analyze learners' CT skills from qualitative and quantitative perspectives. The results show that the evaluation indicators and test questions designed on text-based programming are more consistent with the evaluation objectives.

Educational games have been applied by several researchers to address related issues faced for promoting CT. Even though such games have shown some success in promoting CT, they fall short when it comes to acquisition of CT skills (they rather promote abstract and conceptual knowledge) and offering adaptivity to each player. To address these issues and improve the existing games, we developed an adaptive game called AutoThinking for teaching both CT concepts and skills, engaging students with individually tailored gameplay and learning. We conducted a qualitative study aimed at understanding the cognitive and affective experiences of Estonian primary school children. The findings showed that AutoThinking is making children feel challenged, happy, and confident, while activating their thinking process during the gameplay.

Towards this, we developed a three-week Scratch online professional development(PD) course based on MIT CT framework, then implemented an online training among 84 primary and secondary school teachers from different subjects including Chinese, Mathematics, English, and Computer Science. To examine the effect of its impact on teachers' self-efficacy in CT, a quasi-experiment method of a single group pretest-posttest was conducted, and quantitative and qualitative data were collected from scales, artifacts, and interviews. The results revealed that the online PD course significantly improved teaching self-efficacy in CT of these teachers. The findings indicated that online PD integrated with MIT CT framework through block-based programming was a potential approach to effectively promote teaching self-efficacy in CT for primary and secondary school teachers.",10.1109/EITT50754.2020.00048,IEEE,5.0,IEEE,Computational Thinking;teacher professional development;Scratch;teaching self-efficacy,IEEE Conferences,India,Journal of Machine Learning Research
T{h}inker for Engaging Learning Experience in Computational Thinking and Programming,V. A. Narayanan; C. K. Shyamala; C. S. Velayutham,2019,"This paper aims to study the potential of T{h}inker, a custom designed physical computing toolkit, to engage and enable students from diverse background to focus on the design, problem solving and programming aspects in a fun and creative way. 877 first year undergraduate students from 7 engineering disciplines took a 2 hour laboratory session with T{h}inker and at the end participated in a 5-point Likert scale survey. The survey results showed that T{h}inker provides an engaging way to learn computational thinking and programming; has the potential to offer a variety of project opportunities; is easier to tinker with and (upon little practice) can provide appropriate difficulty level for entry-level undergraduate students while implementing the project ideas. This engaging potential of T{h}inker can be attributed primarily to the exploratory design and problem solving style it promoted in the laboratory against few predefined ways of problem solving expected in typical programming laboratory sessions.",10.1109/EDUCON.2019.8725034,IEEE,5.0,IEEE,physical computing;computational thinking;student engagement;creative development,IEEE Conferences,Japan,Science Advances
Game design workshop to develop computational thinking skills in teenagers with Autism Spectrum Disorders,R. Munoz; T. S. Barcelos; R. Villarroel; I. F. Silveira,2016,"Computational Thinking (CT) has been described as the use of abstraction, automation and analysis skills for problem solving, thus becoming a set of fundamental skills for the 21st century. Many initiatives have emerged to promote early development of CT skills. However, to date, there are no studies in which CT is developed in minority groups, such as individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders. In this paper we present the design and evaluation of a Game Design Workshop aimed at teenagers with Autism Spectrum Disorders.

However, monitoring the learning progress of students is still a hurdle to teachers and researchers. In this context, we explore the use of self-organizing maps for analyzing games produced in a game building workshop offered simultaneously to technical education students in Brazil and to undergraduate students in Computer Engineering in Chile. Metrics from seven CT features present in the games were extracted with the Dr. Scratch tool and used as an input in the training process. The results allowed a clustering analysis considering the identified features and the correlation between learning behaviors. The organization of the map reflected a progressive skill acquisition identified by features present in the developed games.

Paudel,2020,"This Research to Practice Full Paper presents our experience of positive outcomes with increased motivation and retention in teaching an introductory Computer Science course with Python programming. Without reinventing the wheel, we infused few well established pedagogies by integrating and evaluating Computational Thinking (CT) skills in a meaningful way. We integrated CT with existing curriculum alongside programming and teaching general problem-solving techniques with a flowchart-based programming environment and without using specific programming concepts or languages at the beginning. Our aim here is not only to teach a programming language per se, but also to teach, at the beginning, the different ways of problem solving, logical reasoning, algorithm design, and programming constructs with minimal or no emphasis on syntax. A positive learning experience is successfully developed for our students by using appropriate pedagogies and strategies. To evaluate the impact of this infusion, a pre- and post-survey as well as a pre- and post-CT test were conducted on student cohort in different sections.

Supporting Teachers to Integrate Computational Thinking Equitably,M. Coenraad; K. Mills; V. L. Byrne; D. J. Ketelhut,2020,"Broadening participation and increasing equity in computer science (CS) have been goals of the computing field for decades. Initiatives seeking to increase access to CS have led to an increase in elementary schools teaching computational thinking (CT), but students are often instructed by classroom teachers who have no formal training in CT or CS. Our project prepares in-service and pre-service elementary teachers to integrate CT into their science lessons. While our overall goal was to increase CT access for all students, we found some teachers enacted CT in ways that did not always provide equal access to all students. Although our professional development adopted a CS for All approach, without explicit supports, a group of teachers implemented CT in ways often upholding the current trends of inequity and power structures within CS. Our findings suggest teachers would benefit from explicit support to provide opportunities for students currently underrepresented in CS and to offer more equitable opportunities to students regardless of their CS background.",10.1109/RESPECT49803.2020.9272488,IEEE,2.0,IEEE,computational thinking;professional development;equity;computer science education;science education,IEEE Conferences,Spain,ACM Transactions on Graphics

Feng,2022,"This study reports a pre-college initiative that aims to integrate computational thinking (CT) in an integrated STEM learning environment in community centers' after-school programs for upper-level elementary school students. The initiative takes a collaborative approach that engages a range of stakeholders including higher institution's STEM educational researchers and disciplinary experts, a school district, three community centers and their satellite campus that serve Title I schools, and both in-service and pre-service teachers to develop and implement an integrated “STEM + CT” curriculum. The design and development of the integrated STEM+CT curriculum was guided by project-based learning (PBL) that engages students in sustained project-based activities and requires students to apply multiple STEM content knowledge and skills to solve a problem, in after-school programs where they enjoy large blocks of dedicated time to learn and practice CT and STEM. The implementation of the curriculum was led by in-service teachers in community centers' after-school programs who serve as facilitators and learners, and bring a depth of pedagogical knowledge, and who also benefit from such sustained interactions. This collaborative initiative brings relevant stakeholders together and helps build a researcher-practitioner partnership that aims to design, study, improve, and scale innovations in teaching and learning, which facilities the solving of a shared challenge of educational practice - how to integrate CT in K-12 STEM learning? - in this study.

A STEM Course for Computational Thinking Development with BEAM Robotics,C. Boya-Lara; D. Diaz-Solano; A. Fehrenbach; D. Saavedra,2022,"This document describes the development of a STEM course intended to improve the Computational Thinking of university students (CT). The main instructional tool for this course is the BEAM robot, a robotics paradigm that proposes simple robots whose behavior can be controlled without software programming. The programming of this robot is implicit in its morphology, so its actions and goals are codified from its construction. A three-phase curriculum is designed to achieve the objective: propaedeutic, robot assembly, and CT. On the basis of these phases, the course is constructed modularly and implemented virtually, while students receive construction kits. Each phase aims to foster the many facets of CT, such as decomposition, abstraction, algorithm, debugging, iteration, and generalization. Students’ responses to pre-and post-course surveys, as well as evaluation activities and logs, are analyzed to determine the course’s impact on them.

Computational Thinking (CT) and Rebel game Design: CT in health games,H. Lim,2017,"Game-based learning (GBL) is a popular innovative pedagogical framework for developing Computational Thinking (CT) skills. The base idea is to use games to help create awareness and generated needed CT skills and abilities; in short, it is “games for CT” approach. This is however, one part of the equation for understanding and developing CT in our modern digital age. The other part of the equation lies in using “CT for games”. This paper addresses this perspective to aid in the understanding and framing of the elusive CT concept. In “CT for games”, this paper highlights and draws attention to using CT for developing games instead of using games to develop CT. The core contributions of the paper are a “CT for games” proposed framework; selected variants of health games and observations of “Rebel Design”. Readers can benefit from a perspective with a different focus and increase awareness and understanding of CT with the hope of grooming future leaders with required CT problem-solving skills and abilities and applying “Rebel Design” for games.",10.1109/SeGAH.2017.7939263,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,computational thinking (CT);rebel design;game;problem solving;connected;digital ecosystem;framework,IEEE Conferences,India,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering

Gamified forms: a proposal for teaching training based on Computational Thinking,C. F. Rodrigues; I. F. Silveira,2021,"The disappointing results that Brazilian education has been showing in external evaluations by international organizations cause us concern. Technologies are here to stay and it is therefore necessary, in some way, to change this paradigm with regard to the role that the teacher plays, from consumer to producer of technological resources.

As a proposal, a suggestion of gamified activity in the style of a game known as “escape room” was presented, using the Google Forms tool. We note that insecurity with technological tools or lack of knowledge about some features of these same tools is still a factor that causes many concerns among teachers. We concluded that reflection on ourpractice is fundamental, and, in a way, we realize that we have managed to broaden our horizons about the use of certain technological tools.",10.1109/LACLO54177.2021.00105,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Computational Thinking;Gamification;Teacher Training,IEEE Conferences,Japan,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering

Developing Computational Thinking and Reading and Writing Skills through an Approach for Creating Games,K. T. Fernandes; E. H. da Silva Aranha; M. J. N. R. Lucena; G. L. de Souza Fernandes,2020,"Research and full paper. Digital games are increasingly a part of our daily lives and are already considered teaching and learning tools. However, its production and documentation is a very complicated task that requires programming skills and knowledge from different areas. This has hampered the development of games in the classroom environment. On the other hand, some teachers have proposed this activity to enable their students to learn school content in a more meaningful way and, consequently, improve learning rates. An alternative for the adoption of game-based learning is an unplugged approach for creating games based on natural language, in which students learn the fundamentals of computing in a playful way and without the use of computers. In this context, this article presents an approach that proposes the creation of games in an unplugged way by using texts produced by students, thus favoring the development of computational thinking and reading and writing skills in the classroom. Also, it may support the students' interest in the computing area by motivating them to enter a higher education course or pursue a career in that area.

This integrated STEM experience helped a team of researchers that included students from K-12, undergraduate students, graduate students and faculty to collaboratively understand, design and test potential solutions to the problem. The team employed an engineering based Design-Thinking framework combined with effective brainstorming strategies that have been well-established in business, marketing and commercial environments along with a computational mathematics problem solving approach. Not only this integrated STEM experience provided an opportunity for the team of researchers to develop professionally but also gave them an opportunity to become change agents to transform institutional practices and to engage the broader community to inspire the next generation STEM workforce. Specifically, the project framework guided the research team to propose potential integrated STEM based solutions including the application of drones to track illegal poaching as well as the development of an intelligent sensor based tracking system which are validated via sophisticated mathematical and probabilistic algorithms. This overall experience has clearly helped to establish STEM education partnerships and alliances outside traditional boundaries and has helped to create new synergies for all stakeholders who are invested in solving the problem of poaching.

A Robotics-based Learning Environment Supporting Computational Thinking Skills — Design and Development,K. Tengler; O. Kastner-Hauler; B. Sabitzer,2021,"This Research to Practice Full Paper presents the development of a robotics-based learning environment using an educational design research approach. Contemporary teaching should prepare learners for everyday and working life, suggesting that this can only be achieved by implementing Digital Education from primary education onwards. Since computer science education is planned to be anchored in the Austrian primary school curriculum as an interdisciplinary competence development, research into teaching methods and content suitable for this area is becoming increasingly necessary. In this context, the transfer of innovations and didactic approaches into teaching is one of the biggest challenges. Introducing coding and robotics would be a possible strategy. Educational robotics provide access to real-world scenarios and offer age-appropriate possibilities to explore digital aspects of living and working environments. Combined with narrative methods, such as digital storytelling, problem-solving skills could be developed. Since the implementation of computer science in primary education requires practical and theoretical knowledge, an educational design approach is used that takes this aspect into account and allows close interaction between researchers and practitioners. This paper focuses on investigating a feasible and effective robotics-based learning environment for developing and supporting problem-solving skills at primary school using the learning and teaching method digital storytelling. Hence, the development of the learning environment and the didactic approach gained from qualitative results of interviews and observations from the first cycle of the research project are presented, providing plausible arguments for further implementing this robotics-based learning environment.",10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637351,IEEE,5.0,IEEE,computational thinking;educational robotics;digital storytelling;primary school,IEEE Conferences,Brazil,Journal of Computer Science
How do Bebras Tasks Explore Algorithmic Thinking Skill in a Computational Thinking Contest?,A. L. S. Oliveira; W. L. Andrade; D. D. S. Guerrero; M. R. A. Melo,2021,"This Research-to-Practice Full Paper examines the Bebras Challenge tasks, a Computational Thinking (CT) contest that does not require programming knowledge. Numerous studies in the last decade shed light on disseminating CT practices. However, there is still a gap in understanding CT as a construct, that is, CT as a complex cognitive dimension. Furthermore, few studies analyze how many constructs can be recognized inside CT by empirical data. Moreover, algorithmic thinking is one of the essential skills in CT, even when we do not apply programming activities. In this exploratory paper, we investigate the Bebras Challenge tasks. Our primary aim is to figure out how many and which are the constructs associated with CT skills derived from data, especially related to algorithmic thinking. The results point out three primary constructs supported by data. We claim that these constructs are a mix of CT skills, mainly algorithmic thinking, abstraction, generalization, evaluation, and pattern recognition. In addition, our study provides additional evidence supporting the idea that algorithmic thinking can be explored by different perspectives beyond “a set of order instructions”, even without programming practices. Thus, this result reinforces the notion that CT can be understood as a mix of several skills to solve problems. Moreover, algorithmic thinking is a complex cognitive process of thought which may be explored through different strategies. We believe that these findings may help recognize which constructs and abilities underline CT, primarily algorithmic thinking without programming activities.",10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637151,IEEE,3.0,IEEE,,IEEE Conferences,Chile,Computers & Education

Critical computational empowerment: Engaging youth as shapers of the digital future,M. Tissenbaum; J. Sheldon; L. Seop; C. H. Lee; N. Lao,2017,"While there is growing recognition of the need to support young learners as they develop computational thinking (CT) skills, this paper advocates for an increased focus on computational identity (CI) and digital empowerment (DE) in particular, as we posit that these CT skills will help young learners become self-motivated, innovative creators. When nurturing identity and empowerment, it is a persistent challenge to provide youth with real-world experiences and suitable development tools. This paper advances two key approaches to address these issues: 1) A critical computational literacy approach to engage youth in developing personally meaningful applications that have impact in the real world; 2) the use of a tool, like MIT App Inventor, that lowers barriers to creating useful, impactful technology. Using two case-based studies, we show how these two approaches have supported youth in developing applications that respond to meaningful challenges in their communities and helped them to establish their computational identities and digital empowerment.",10.1109/EDUCON.2017.7943078,IEEE,15.0,IEEE,computational thinking;digital empowerment;computational identity,IEEE Conferences,Argentina,Computers & Education

Concepts of Engineering Education Innovation and Design Thinking: Implementing the CDIO-approach Themes,H. Al-Juboori; G. Noonan,2024,"The CDIO Framework within engineering education is based on the idea that graduates should be capable of conceiving, designing, implementing, and operating (i.e., CDIO) complex systems within a team-based learning environment. As an approach to engineering education, it aims to create an active, experiential learning setting where product and process are considered fundamental to the curriculum. Modern pedagogical strategies and innovative teaching methods allow for the implementation of the CDIO approach, where students are supported to develop deep knowledge, manage the process of designing and exploiting new items and systems, and evaluate the impact of the scientific-technological process on society. This article will highlight aspects of this approach in the development of a practical quantum electronics session. In particular, it will focus on the developed principles of an innovative practice-targeted programme that can support the development of students' engineering thinking through the linkage of education and professional activities. As graduates, the students will need to be able to create innovative engineering systems as well as integrate their understanding of natural and technological sciences to generate novel concepts. They will also need to be proficient in professional ethics and have knowledge of business and entrepreneurship fundamentals. As such, this indicates the need for a strategically-focused curriculum that supports the development of a range of transversal skills required for industry. In this paper, the CDIO model is detailed as a means of transforming engineering education on a large scale. In order to develop the fundamental framework of creative awareness sessions for quantum technologies and their applications, this study attempted to further explore and provide more specific illustrations of the concepts relating to CIDO and to consider how they may be applied within an engineering context. The current work will present and evaluate the principles of an innovative teaching technique aimed at providing students with the opportunities to understand pioneering technologies for future applications.",10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578801,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,education research schemes;education in the industry 5.0 era;design thinking and innovation for education;Remote Classrooms,IEEE Conferences,Canada,PLOS ONE
Virtual experiment teaching and research oriented to college computer curriculum,F. Li; Y. Chen; Y. Yu; B. Zhang; M. Sun,2016,"In recent years, with the rise of the concept of Computational Thinking, the issue about College Computer teaching reforms has received wide attention. A high percentage of the research nowadays focuses on how to impart knowledge of computer in the perspective of computational thinking. But more importantly, the research ignores an important way to train thinking - practice. This paper starts with the “College Computer Curriculum”, which is the first computer course for undergraduate students. By using virtual reality technology, this paper gives the college teacher an experimental design method of “College Computer Curriculum”. Some exploratory research works have been performed to explain how to embody the basic problems of computer public course.

A Framework to Assess Melodic Effectiveness in Training Computational Thinking to Visually Impaired People,R. Costa; A. C. Neto; C. Araújo; P. R. Henriques,2022,"Computational Thinking education and training are considered crucial activities to achieve success in later challenges like computer programming. To train the brain to think in logical terms it is necessary to use adequate resources. In this paper we address the difficult problem that is assessing efficacy of a given resource to the Computation Thinking development. To discuss that topic we will use the Melodic System which is a physical learning resource capable of constructing melodic sequences in a logical manner to be used by visually impaired people. Melodic was created aiming at training Computational Thinking through music and sounds and its impact in the learning process must be evaluated.

The significant of algorithm defines Computational thinking (CT) as one of the 21st Century skills. Although CT has been integrated into the education in the past years, many students still struggle with CT concept due to the complication of the topic and limited learning methods provided in school environment. To provide alternative learning approach for algorithmic thinking, we propose a game-base learning system called Protobot.

Soh,2017,"Computational thinking and creative thinking are valuable tools both within and outside of computer science (CS). The goal of the project discussed here is to increase students' achievement in CS courses through a series of computational creativity exercises (CCEs). In this paper, the framework of CCEs is described, and the results of two separate studies on their impact on student achievement are presented. Students in introductory CS courses completed CCEs as part of those courses. Students in Study 1 came from a variety of programs, and students in Study 2 were engineering majors. A profiling approach was used to test whether the impact of the CCEs could be accounted for by differences in students' motivated and self-regulated engagement. Overall, CCEs had positive impacts on students' grades and knowledge test scores, and although there were differences in achievement across the profiles, the impact of the CCEs was generally consistent across profiles. The CCEs appear to be a promising way to increase student achievement in introductory CS courses.

Development and Validation of the Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic for Undergraduate Students,N. V. Mendoza Diaz; S. Y. Yoon; D. A. Trytten; R. Meier,2023,"Computational thinking is one barrier to enculturating as a professional engineer. We created the Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic (ECTD) as an instructional tool that can identify at-risk first-year engineering students. The purpose of this study is to provide construct validity, internal consistency reliability, item characteristics, and criterion validity evidence for this diagnostic. From fall 2020 to fall 2021, 469 students from three institutions in the United States took the diagnostic. The data from 152 students at one institution was used to provide evidence of predictive validity. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses resulted in 20 items loading onto one factor in a good model fit range, with the internal consistency reliability coefficient, Cronbach  $\alpha $  of 0.86. From item analyses based on classical test theory, the diagnostic items on average tended to be slightly easy but had sufficient discrimination power. The correlation matrix for criterion validity evidence indicated that the diagnostic functions well to differentiate students’ computational thinking ability by prior computer science course experience as well as by first-generation status. Predictive validity evidence from regression analyses revealed the statistically significant effect of students’ diagnostic scores assessed at the beginning of the first semester on predicting their end of semester course grades. The ECTD can have a broad impact because it provides a tool to gauge the entry-level skills of students, enabling early curriculum interventions to help retention and persistence to graduation. We make the case that the ECTD could contribute to the development of a more diverse workforce in engineering.",10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3335931,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Computer science education;computational thinking;diagnostic method;student assessment tools;engineering education;first-year engineering student experience;quantitative research methods;retention;validity;factor analysis,IEEE Journals,Chile,Journal of Computer Science

Serey Guerrero,2016,"Several initiatives have been created to promote Computational Thinking (CT) abilities in students. There are multiple approaches of assessing CT and wide abilities and skills involved. However, the evidence on how to assess CT has not yet been systematically grouped or reviewed. The goal of our study is to identify and classify approaches to promote CT and the different ways of assessing CT abilities. To achieve this goal, a systematic mapping study was planned and executed. The results reveal that: (i) programming courses are the most common pedagogical approaches to promote CT for K-12 students; (ii) multiple skills are involved in CT, but solving problems, algorithms, and abstraction are most common abilities assessed; and (iii) codes and multi-choice questionnaires are the most common artifacts for assessing CT abilities.

Digital ink for cognitive assessment of computational thinking,A. P. Ambrósio; C. Xavier; F. Georges,2014,"Cognitive testing is concerned with quantitative and qualitative evaluation of an individual's intellectual functioning in its broad sense. Tests for evaluating cognitive components are based on submitting the subject to a given task and then assessing performance according to an established set of reference parameters. In order to analyze subject's behavior and test results, a software tool was developed based upon digital ink technology, which permits the digitalization of the assessment procedure, from the undertaking of the test to the production of the assessment results. By doing so, the test procedure is computerized and its data is saved in InkML format and processed to analyze tasks previously defined by the evaluator. We have used this tool to develop a Computational Thinking test defined within the Cattell-Horn-Carroll CHC framework of intelligence. Further investigating the relationship between fluid intelligence and computational thinking allows a better understanding of the main set of cognitive skills which need to be developed by students and professionals that aim to work in this domain. Moreover, it is suggested that assessments, independent of their context, may benefit from using the InkML tool, mainly due to the richer set of information that can be collected.",10.1109/FIE.2014.7044237,IEEE,21.0,IEEE,computational thinking;digital ink;task analysis;tools;cognitive assessment,IEEE Conferences,China,Journal of Computer Science
Development and Implementation of an Online Adaptive Gamification Platform for Learning Computational Thinking,A. K. Ng; I. Atmosukarto; W. S. Cheow; K. Avnit; M. H. Yong,2021,"This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents the development and implementation of an innovative online adaptive gamification platform for learning Computational Thinking (CT). CT is an essential problem-solving skill set in this modern era of digitization and technological advancements. To build students' knowledge and skills in CT while maximizing students' motivation and engagement in learning, a novel online adaptive gamified course called Computational Thinking Quest (CTQ) was introduced. The CTQ was designed and developed by a multidisciplinary team of students and faculty members. The key features of CTQ are (1) an interactive storyline with animated avatars, mini-games, and questions created using Unity three-dimensional cross-platform game engine and Blockly block-based visual programming language; (2) questions at three different levels of difficulty for effective adaptive and self-learning approach; (3) an answer and feedback to each question for increased students' confidence and enthusiasm towards learning; (4) hyperlinks to online learning resources for further reading; (5) a badge and a leaderboard to motivate active participation and encourage success; and (6) a course management system with automatic data saving capability to enable learning at own pace, anytime, anywhere. The CTQ was rolled out to some newly matriculated first-year undergraduate Engineering (ENG) and InfoComm Technology (ICT) students. A total of 54 ENG and 53 ICT students' learning performance and feedback were collated and analyzed. Statistical results from the paired Student's t-test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test consistently reveal that (1) the median of post-test marks is significantly higher than that of pre-test marks (p < 0.001); (2) the median of CT knowledge scores after taking CTQ is significantly higher than that of before CTQ (p < 0.001); and (3) the median time taken to complete the post-test is significantly lower than the pre-test (p < 0.001). Furthermore, more than 75% of ENG and ICT students, separately, stated that CTQ is an engaging or very engaging learning platform; 81% of them indicated that the educational content of CTQ is enriching or very enriching; and 83% of them commented that CTQ has motivated independent learning. The CTQ can also serve as a bridging course to narrow the heterogeneity gap among students with heterogeneous prior knowledge on computer programming languages and ease students into programming-related modules, thereby enhancing teaching and learning effectiveness.",10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637467,IEEE,7.0,IEEE,computational thinking;gamification;adaptive learning;independent learning;online education platform,IEEE Conferences,Brazil,Science Advances
"Computational Thinking Test for Lower Primary Students: Design Principles, Content Validation, and Pilot Testing",S. Zhang; G. K. W. Wong; G. Pan,2021,"Computational Thinking (CT) is an essential skill in digital society. With the growing momentum in integrating CT into K-12 education, a higher need can be seen in developing proper assessment tools to measure what students have learned about CT. Although numerous attempts have been made to design CT assessment tools, there is a scarcity of well-validated tests for summative assessment aimed at lower primary students. To bridge this gap, we designed the Computational Thinking Test for Lower Primacy (CTt-LP), targeting students aged 6–8. This study presents the test design, content validation, and pilot testing. For test design, Evidence-Centered Design (ECD) was applied, and four constructs were selected. A total of 30 items were designed, after which content validation was performed via expert judgement and cognitive interviews with students. Revisions were made based on the validation results. The pilot testing was conducted in a public primary school in northern China, with 72 participants from Grade 2. Results indicate that the test is balanced regarding the difficulty level for the target group.

Developing Future Computational Thinking in Foundational CS Education: A Case Study From a Liberal Education University in India,B. Kalluri; P. Prasad; P. Sharma; D. Chippa,2024,"Contribution: This article proposes a new theoretical model with a goal to develop future human computational thinking (CT) in foundational computer science (CS) education. The model blends six critical types of thinking, i.e., logical thinking, systems thinking, sustainable thinking, strategic thinking, creative thinking, and responsible thinking into the design of a first-year undergraduate programming course. The study describes a creative blended pedagogy that embeds the proposed model into the course plan. Background: The emergence of artificial intelligent systems such as large language models from a knowledge provider perspective, coupled with a gradual change in post-pandemic outlook of education challenge the relevance and raises concerns about the future of education. The 21st-century human CT requirements, viz., learning to code (skill) and thinking computationally (competency), will be inadequate in the future. Moreover, there is substantial evidence which shows that most introductory programming courses fail to integrate critical elements like ethics and responsibility as part of the course. Intended Outcomes: The authors anticipate experiential learning models such as this has immense potential to future-proof CS education, as well as make future software engineers responsible citizens. Application Design: The proposed model blends six types of thinking into the design and activities of the course. The underlying theoretical basis of these activities revolve around three key principles: 1) experiential learning; 2) self-reflection; and 3) peer learning. Findings: This case study from a liberal educational institution in India qualitatively shows evidence of students developing six critical elements of thinking that shapes their future CT ability.",10.1109/TE.2024.3394060,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,21st-century skills;computer science (CS);creative pedagogy;foundational education;future thinking,IEEE Early Access Articles,USA,Computers & Education

Exploring the Balance Between Computational Thinking and Learning Motivation in Elementary Programming Education: An Empirical Study With Game-Based Learning,H. Liu; Z. Wu; Y. Lu; L. Zhu,2023,"Computational thinking (CT) skills are generally regarded as a basic ability for problem-solving and are gradually filtering down to younger age groups. Existing research has attempted to increase interaction and enhance the learning interest of elementary school students through block-based programming environments represented by Scratch. However, criticism suggests that this approach has potential long-term constraints on CT education. Therefore, this study designed a game-based project to investigate students’ learning motivation and CT performance in different programming environments. A total of 108 fifth-grade students participated in the experiment and were divided into two experimental groups (EG1 and EG2) and a control group (CG). The students in experimental groups all undertook game-based learning, while EG1 students used C++ and EG2 students used Scratch; CG students used C++ for traditional algorithm-based learning. Findings suggest that traditional programming languages with game-based learning can also substantially improve learning interest, which can promote the efficiency of improving CT for students who already have some motivation and foundation for learning. But for students who still lack motivation, are also encouraged to develop an interest in a block-based programming environment. Teachers can choose the most appropriate approach for students to find the best balance between learning efficiency and long-term interest.",10.1109/TG.2022.3143701,IEEE,5.0,IEEE,Computational thinking (CT);elementary education;game-based learning;learning motivation;programming,IEEE Journals,Brazil,PLOS ONE

Teachers' Intention to Integrate Computational Thinking Skills in Higher Education: A Survey Study in the Netherlands,X. Zhang; E. Aivaloglou; M. Specht,2024,"Computational Thinking (CT) is vital in today's digital era, especially in Engineering Education. While no official policy or teaching framework on CT education has been established in the Netherlands, a Western European country, there have been various initiatives for the integration of CT into the curriculum. Recognizing the crucial role of teachers in CT integration, we surveyed the perceptions and intentions of teachers in tertiary education in the Netherlands. Our survey encompassed two aspects: (1) teachers' perceptions of CT, and (2) their intentions to integrate CT into pedagogical activities. 38 teachers, mostly in Engineering Education, from across the Netherlands completed the questionnaire based on the UTAUT framework. Regarding CT perceptions, our investigation reveals that teachers possess an inadequate understanding of the relationship between CT and Computer Science, have limited training experiences in CT, and hold differing opinions on when and which constructs of CT should be integrated into different domains. Concerning teachers' intentions to integrate CT, the results exhibited a strong positive correlation between performance expectancy, attitude towards CT, and behavioral intention to implement CT in learning activities. To foster the integration of CT in tertiary education, our findings suggest the need for further development of higher education teacher training programs focused on CT and its relation to CS.

In this paper, we use the concept of identities-in-practice as an analytical frame to examine how girls of color engage in computational thinking practices. Our research investigates how the identities of girls of color can be leveraged as funds of knowledge in learning spaces and asks the following research question: How does centering the identities of girls of color impact their engagement with computational thinking practices? We provide a program overview of CompuGirls, describe our curricular design approach, and share results from pilot implementations of the program offered at public libraries in Michigan, Arizona, and California. Results from our pilot year demonstrate that integrating identity exploration into a computational thinking curriculum results in a mutually reinforcing relationship where girls of color experience reflective identity development while simultaneously increasing their understanding of computational thinking. We present our approach as a promising avenue for connecting computing knowledge and skills to girls' identities and lived experiences. By focusing on the girls' identities, the program re-imagines computational experiences by fostering interactions with computational thinking from a personal perspective.

Computational Thinking Skills for Today and Tomorrow’s Talent,H. Saleh,2017,"Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Computational thinking (CT) is a term invented by “J.M. Wing, 2006” to describe a set of thinking skills, behaviors, and approaches that are integral to solving complex challenges using a computer and widely applicable in the information society. CT is a must for today’s and tomorrow’s talent. The added-value of this early exposure to CT is that it will help juniors to shape a solid basis of algorithmic and data structures, which form the basic nuts and bolts of the mechanics of computer programming. The added value of developing professionals has its clear impact on the economy perspective, in light of the forecasted demand for today and tomorrow. (World economic forum, 2017) Computer programming is an outstanding way to develop computational thinking skills. It has been taken programming as a useful way for juniors to learn problem solving and computational thinking with an affirmative and quantifiable effect on juniors’ achievement, not only in areas such as math and science, but also in language skills, creativity, interpersonal skills and social emotional interaction.",10.1109/ICCTA43079.2017.9497195,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,,IEEE Conferences,Mexico,Journal of Computer Science
Hash-Based Convolutional Deep-thinking Pattern Classifier,C. Wang; Z. Man; J. Jin; W. Ye,2023,"To address pattern classification problems without involving complex computations, a Hash-Based Convolutional Deep-Thinking Pattern Classifier (HCDTPC) has been developed. This classifier draws inspiration from the human visual system and human thinking logic. The architecture consists of five layers, each serving a distinct purpose. In the initial convolutional layer, informative and distinct features are extracted, mimicking the functionality of the human visual system. The subsequent clustering layer employs a clustering algorithm to group samples within a class into smaller clusters. This arrangement allows the following layer to compare test samples across different clusters, replicating a human-like classification process where the most similar samples should belong to the same group. The hashing layer of the devised system employs a similarity-preserve hashing technique to transform feature maps into hashed data. This transformation reduces the dimensionality of the data while retaining essential similarity information. In the logical layer, Bayesian inference is employed to classify testing samples, mirroring human thought processes. The simulation section assesses the performance of the HCDTPC, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in pattern classification.",10.1109/ICAMechS59878.2023.10272839,IEEE,2.0,IEEE,Convolutional Neural Network;Hashing Technique;Deep-Thinking Pattern Classifier;Classification,IEEE Conferences,China,ACM Transactions on Graphics

Automated Personalized Assessment of Computational Thinking MOOC Assignments,H. M. Jamil,2017,"One of the major hurdles toward automatic semantic understanding of computer programs is the lack of knowledge about what constitutes functional equivalence of code segments. We postulate that a sound knowledgebase can be used to deductively understand code segments in a hierarchical fashion by first de-constructing a code and then reconstructing it from elementary knowledge and equivalence rules of elementary code segments. The approach can also be engineered to produce computable programs from conceptual and abstract algorithms as an inverse function. In this paper, we introduce the core idea behind the MindReader online assessment system that is able to understand a wide variety of elementary algorithms students learn in their entry level programming classes such as Java, C++ and Python.

However, few of them focused on basic psychological needs satisfaction (BPNS) and behavioral engagement. Since needs satisfaction could influence intrinsic motivation and lead to better performance. It is critical to understand whether, and to what extent, the learners’ CT skills are influenced by the level of BPNS. In light of this, the work-in-progress study employed a semester-long intervention to explore the role of BPNS in students’ CT skill development.

Physical and Digital Twin with Computational Thinking to Foster STEM Vocations in Primary Education,X. P. I. Palomés; J. Verdaguer-Codina; P. F. I. Casas; J. L. Rubiés-Viera,2024,"This work aims to explore the application of the physical and digital twin pair as a computational thinking instrument to support learning and exercise proportional reasoning at the ages at which pursuing STEM studies is decided. Diverse studies reveal that the initial decision about the vocation in studies is made towards the end of the primary education stage, also from 8–9 years old. The Digital Transformation Commission of the Engineering Associations of Catalonia is concerned about the low number of young people who decide to pursue STEM studies. STEM explorations in early childhood lay the foundation for lifelong learning. In addition, from age 5, children informally begin to practice proportional reasoning, and in the third year of primary school (8–9 years old), the subject is formally introduced into the Primary Education curriculum. The notion of proportionality is very transversal, and it is one of the fundamental concepts of the STEM field. The consequences of an incomplete understanding of it directly or indirectly affect the attitude of subjects toward mathematics and the STEM world. With the emergence of Industry 4.0, the digital twin concept is becoming one of the central instruments of Digital Transformation. In this paper, we propose using computational thinking to help the understanding of proportional thinking using a physical and digital twin pair. In 2022, computational thinking was introduced into the Spanish and Catalan educational system's early childhood, primary, and secondary education curricula. It includes programming with block languages such as Scratch or Snap!. A digital twin of the system has also been implemented in Snap!. Through the collaboration of a primary school, a workshop has been prepared in which they exercise the concepts of proportional reasoning, such as ratio, proportion, scale, or percentage. The approach followed has consisted of developing a physical system of a floating ball, controlling the electric motor's power with an electronic system based on low-cost elements from the maker world. We have designed a very easy-to-use system for any teacher, and its open-source nature ensures its transparency and documentation. The foam ball rises and remains floating at a height determined by the power supplied to the motor. The control of the system is carried out with Snap!. It will be assumed that the engine revolutions are proportional to the power setpoint. The physical system generates a high level of expectation and attention in the students, facilitating the process of its abstraction. The range of options of the developed system allows experimenting with the actual system and a schematic digital twin with sound effects. In all cases, the same computational thinking tools have been used to exercise the concepts and powerful ideas of proportional reasoning. At the end of the workshop, the understanding of the concepts exercised and the assessment of their personal experience were evaluated. This gave us helpful information to motivate students of these ages and below to maintain their STEM vocation.",10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578918,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Microworlds;Digital Twin;STEM;Computational Thinking;Proportional Reasoning,IEEE Conferences,USA,Journal of Machine Learning Research
"Fostering computational thinking in engineering education: Challenges, examples, and best practices",S. Gross; M. Kim; J. Schlosser; C. Mohtadi; D. Lluch; D. Schneider,2014,"Computational Thinking is a core capability for most engineers. The term summarizes a set of skills needed to transform real-life challenges into problems that can be solved with the help of a computer and to apply computer-based solutions to questions at hand. This mindset is fundamental to almost every engineering task. However, teaching Computational Thinking is a great challenge for educators worldwide. In designing and implementing university curricula, one has to take an increasing number of arguments into consideration. Technological progress requires the design, creation, and analysis of increasingly large and complex systems. Engineering working environments and tasks demand interdisciplinary teams and close communication between involved groups. In designing engineering curricula, these factors need to be considered and the necessary skills must be implicitly or explicitly developed. This paper highlights three examples of classes and projects aimed at enabling students to develop and increase Computational Thinking through systematic introduction of computational tools. From these successful case studies, the paper derives six best practices for fostering Computational Thinking in engineering education.

Leveraging ChatGPT to Enhance Computational Thinking Learning Experiences,A. Ouaazki; K. Bergram; A. Holzer,2023,"Given the pervasive reliance on technology in modern society, teaching Computational Thinking (CT) abilities is becoming increasingly relevant. These abilities, such as modeling and coding, have become crucial for a larger audience of students, not only those who wish to become software engineers or computer scientists. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, provide powerful assistance to complete computational tasks, by simplifying code generation and debugging, and potentially enhancing interactive learning. However, it is not clear if these advances make CT tasks more accessible and inclusive for all students, or if they further contribute to a digital skills divide, favoring the top students. To address this gap, we have created and evaluated a novel learning scenario for transversal CT skills that leveraged LLMs as assistants. We conducted an exploratory field study during the spring semester of 2022, to assess the effectiveness and user experience of LLM-augmented learning. Our results indicate that the usage of ChatGPT as a learning assistant improves learning outcomes. Furthermore, contrary to our predictions, the usage of ChatGPT by students does not depend on prior CT capabilities and as such does not seem to exacerbate prior inequalities.",10.1109/TALE56641.2023.10398358,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Large Language Models;Interactive Learning Environments;Collaborative Learning;Human-Computer Interaction,IEEE Conferences,France,Computers & Education
The Psychology of Thinking in Creating AI,P. Saariluoma; A. Karvonen,2021,"The broad-scale emergence of AI in industry calls forth basic questions in terms of the knowledge bases and approaches relevant for its design. Engineering design has been mainly developed for electromechanical artifacts. In practice, this has meant that the scientific knowledge required for creating technical artifacts such as engines, cars, ships, cranes, telephones, radios, TVs, and simple data processing units has been natural science. However, one cannot find intelligent processes by means of physics and chemistry. Natural scientific phenomena follow their deterministic laws, but intelligence is based on selection and decision processes. The conceptual landscape of natural science is optimized for different kinds of phenomena than intelligent information processing. Consequently, the basic research under technology design should be rethought in light of the emergence of AI. To grasp intelligent information processing, we need concepts and approaches suited for the task. To create intelligent technologies on this basis, we need concepts and approaches that afford the operationalization of such information in artificial systems.

Influence of College Teacher’s Instructional Design on the Development of College Students’ Thinking of Innovation Multi-Algorithms Perspective Analysis,L. Wang; J. Zhou; X. Li,2024,"At present, innovation courses for college students play a vital role in universities. It has also become an important teaching platform for cultivating superior talents. How to improve the level of innovative thinking of college students into high-quality national strategic talents has become a research topic of great concern. However, many university teachers still follow traditional instructional design. It is impossible to implement a customized approach to education. Responding to the deficiencies in the instructional design of innovative training for university students, the support vector machine and K-means clustering algorithms are combined to create a revolutionary network instructional system, which is then used in an undergraduate course. A virtual reality classroom, real-time chat features, and an evaluation system are just a few of the elements that make up this system. It makes it possible to personalize learning, share open data, have real-time debates, and participate in a variety of virtual learning activities. Through the use of conventional datasets, this integrated multi-algorithmic system’s dependability is illustrated. It can meet the diverse learning needs of college students and help solve the weaknesses of traditional instructional design. Since 2022, four evaluation techniques have been used to confirm the efficacy of this teaching strategy: student recognition analysis, final test passing rate, competition winning percentage, and classroom activity level assessment. The results support the following: Compared with the traditional teaching design, the novel network instructional system is more conducive to helping college students cultivate learning interests and enhance their innovative thinking level. The adoption and dissemination of this strategy will undoubtedly advance educational research and improve college students’ capacity for creative thought, fostering the development of top-notch creative talent and advancing sustainable societal development.",10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3349979,IEEE,2.0,IEEE,Instructional design;support vector machine;K-means clustering;innovative thinking;instructional system,IEEE Journals,USA,ACM Transactions on Graphics

Towards a Conceptual Model for a Smart Open learning environment based on Computational Thinking,B. Fradi; L. Cheniti-Belcadhi,2022,"Currently, there is a daily evolution of the world and our current digital society faces challenges for changing the environment. Currently, learning environments are undergoing an evolution due the increasing development of mobile technologies. Designing and implementing Smart Learning Environments (SLEs) has emerged to enhance the learning process and the creation of content. In this paper, we are interested on SLE. Our objective is to propose a new pedagogical approach to provide adaptive and personalized open learning based on Computational Thinking (CT). This contribution describes the main theoretical relationships between SLE, Open Learner Model, Open Education Resource, Open Practice and Open Pedagogy when developing SLE to promote the learning process. New pedagogical approaches, based on openness, need to be implemented. The goal is to orchestrate between different features of SLE in order to propose a Smart Open Learning Environment (SOLE). We focus in particular on the pedagogical scenario that will be deployed in a Smart Open Learning Environment (SOLE). The proposed scenario is promoted by Smart Open Pedagogy to enhance CT.

A Typology of Models for Integrating Computational Thinking in Science (CT+S),A. Krakowski; E. Greenwald; M. Comstock; N. Roman; J. Duke,2021,"In order to expand opportunities to learn computer science (CS), there is a growing push for inclusion of CS concepts and practices, such as computational thinking (CT), in required subjects like science. Integrated, transdisciplinary (CS/CT+X) approaches have shown promise for broadening access to CS and CT learning opportunities, addressing potential self-selection bias associated with elective CS coursework and afterschool programs, and promoting a more expansive and authentic contextualization of CS work. Emerging research also points to pedagogical strategies that can transcend simply broadening access, by also working to confront barriers to equitable and inclusive engagement in CS. Yet, approaches to integration vary widely, and there is little consensus on whether and how different models for CS and CT integration contribute to desired outcomes. There has also been little theory development that can ground systematic examination of the affordances and tradeoffs of different models. Toward that end, we propose a typology through which to examine CT integration in science (CT +S). The purpose of delineating a typology of CT+S integration is to encourage instantiation, implementation, and inspection of different models for integration, and to promote shared understanding among learning designers, researchers, and practitioners working at the intersection of CT and science. For each model in the typology, we characterize how CT+S integration is accomplished, the ways in which CT learning supports science learning, and the affordances and tensions for equity and inclusion that may arise upon implementation in science classrooms.",10.1109/RESPECT51740.2021.9620553,IEEE,1.0,IEEE,Equity and inclusion in computing;Computational thinking;Transdisciplinary (CT+X) curriculum models,IEEE Conferences,Brazil,Science Advances
The Future Nexus of Computational Thinking Education: A Preliminary Systematic Review of Reviews,Z. Xie; J. Radloff; G. K. W. Wong; I. H. Yeter,2022,"Recent years have seen a high volume of computational thinking (CT) review studies. However, there have been no existing studies that map these reviews with the goal of achieving comprehensive understanding of the field of CT. This paper utilizes Tikva & Tambouris’ (2021) K-12 CT research domain conceptual model as the basis for identifying and defining CT reviews, then maps the identified 38 CT reviews onto the identified domains. We pinpoint eight potential future review topics, including ""communities"" of tools, ""modeling simulations,"" ""problem-solving"" and ""scaffolding"" of learning strategies, ""demographic attributes"" of factors, ""practices"" and ""perspectives"" of the knowledge-based areas, and the ""teacher training"" of capacity building. We also examine the topical keywords of the reviews and identify that the scope of the term ""unplugged"" is vaguely defined among the existing research, suggesting a need to refine the definition of this frequently discussed topic so as to be able to more effectively conduct supplementary reviews. Our results help to better understand the CT review field and formulate future directions.",10.1109/TALE54877.2022.00096,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Computational thinking;review of reviews;K-12 education,IEEE Conferences,Germany,Journal of Machine Learning Research
Impact of Programming Exposure on the Development of Computational Thinking Capabilities: An Empirical Study,C. Cachero; P. Barra; S. Meliá; O. López,2020,"Today's digital society has turned the development of students' computational thinking capabilities into a critical factor for their future success. As higher education institutions, we need to take responsibility for this development in every degree course we offer, and provide students with the kind of subjects and activities that best contribute to this aim. In this paper, we study the impact of following an introductory programming course on the development of the computational thinking capabilities of university students. In order to achieve this aim, a concurrent cohort observational study was carried out in which we measured both the subjective and objective computational thinking capabilities of 104 participants (50 first year students enrolled on a Bachelor's degree course in Psychology at the Catholic University of Murcia (UCAM), and 54 first year students enrolled on a Bachelor's degree course in Health Information Systems at the University of Alicante (UA)). The statistical procedures applied to test our hypotheses were a two-way mixed ANOVA, a paired-sample T-test and an independent-sample T-test. The data shows that the group at UA had an initial higher subjective perception of their computational capabilities than the group at UCAM. This perception was supported by their objective scores, which were also significantly higher. However, the subjective assessment of computational capability of the UA group diminished after exposure to the programming course, contrasting with the fact that their objective computational capabilities improved significantly. In the UCAM group, both subjective and objective capabilities remained constant over time. Based on these results, we can conclude that computational thinking capabilities are not developed naturally, but need to be trained. Providing such training to all our students, and not only to those enrolled on undergraduate degrees in engineering, is of paramount importance to allow them to face the challenges of their future professions. This paper empirically demonstrates the extent to which exposing subjects to a programming course may contribute to this aim.",10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2987254,IEEE,22.0,IEEE,Programming;computational thinking;problem-solving;career development;technology social factors;observational study,IEEE Journals,Canada,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
Mastering basic Sorting Algorithms through Computational Thinking Activities for Everyone,P. Silapachote; A. Srisuphab; A. Hoonlor; T. Sunetnanta,2024,"Sorting is an algorithmic concept that is covered in every fundamental computer science and engineering course and included in most if not all programming competitions. It is an everyday task, self-taught and done naturally even by a small child. In spite of its ingenuousness, mastering sorting algorithms turns out to be not so simple for many first-time programmers. This happens because how humans perform sorting is far from being straightforwardly aligned with machine instructions. We have developed an unplugged game-based learning activity that aims not only to tackle this difficult dilemma but also to promote computational thinking practice. Our game robustly challenges audiences to complete a fun sorting task algorithmically and the building blocks of the exercise are methodologically grounded in the four cornerstones of computational thinking. Participants are gently guided through solving a problem by decomposing it, recognizing patterns, applying abstraction, writing step-by-step instructions, and finally arriving at a programmable solution. Our design is largely flexible. The game can be played in small groups or larger ones. It uses only common, readily accessible materials, and is easily adaptable to different levels of audiences, from the interested general public to secondary school students and teachers, to non-computer science undergraduates and those majoring in engineering or information technology related subjects. We have implemented this activity in our classrooms and conducted several workshops. Responses were markedly positive. Engaged from the beginning to the end, participants enjoyed the activity, having fun sorting. Appreciated the ideas, audiences were captivated by many surprising challenges. Most notably, they were able to comprehend the concepts of sorting algorithms and the computational steps behind them, and gain a better understanding of computational thinking.",10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578701,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,sorting algorithm;computational thinking;game-based learning activities;unplugged computing,IEEE Conferences,USA,Nature Communications
Integrate social simulation content with game designing curriculum to foster computational thinking,C. -K. Chang,2011,"Computational thinking is a fundamental analytical ability to solve problems, design systems, and understand human behavior based on the fundamental concepts of computer science. The concept of computational thinking is almost needed on every profession in the computerization of society. Teaching computational thinking to cultivate problem solving ability by computer is a challenge of computer science education, especially for the K-12 level. Although studies introduce computational concepts by programming design, computational thinking and computer science are not computer programming. The study uses social simulation content (i.e. NetLogo, which uses muti-agent technology) to scaffold learning computational thinking concepts, such as simple genetic algorithm, parallel computing, artificial neural net, or deadlock (such as dining philosophers). To stimulate learning transfer onto computational thinking, NetLogo models library will be used to motivate reflection and meta-cognition development. Preliminary experimental results came from both questionnaires and artifacts. In the future, Gero's (1990) function-behaviour-structure (FBS) ontology will be used for the qualitative analysis to explain the outcomes of learning transfer.",,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,,IEEE Conferences,France,Science Advances

Engaging Primary and Secondary School Students in Computer Science Through Computational Thinking Training,R. Herrero-Álvarez; G. Miranda; C. León; E. Segredo,2023,"Although Computer Science has grown to become one of the most highly demanded professional careers, every year, only a small percentage of students choose a degree directly related to Computer Science. Perhaps the problem lies in the lack of information that society has about Computer Science itself, and particularly about the work computer scientists do. No one doubts the role of Mathematics or Languages as core subjects in every primary and secondary education syllabus; however, Computer Science plays a negligible role in most current syllabuses. Only in a few countries have governments paid special attention to content related to Computer Science and to learning to analyze and solve problems the way computer scientists do (Computational Thinking). In this article, we present Piens@ Computacion@ULLmente, a project that provides a methodology to promote Computer Science through Computational Thinking activities among primary and secondary education students. The results obtained from an exhaustive statistical analysis of the data we collected demonstrate that the perception of Computer Science that pre-university students have can be improved through specific training.

Exploring The Psychometric Properties of Computational Thinking Assessment in Introductory Programming,Y. Anistyasari; E. Ekohariadi; I. G. P. Asto Buditjahjanto; S. C. Hidayati,2021,"Computational thinking (CT) is considered as the skill of 21st century. The fundamental CT concepts include abstraction, algorithm design, decomposition, pattern recognition, and data representation or generalization. CT assessment is required to improve the understanding of the cognitive abilities and to relate them in related areas, such as introductory programming in computer science. Assessing computational thinking skills however is a challenging issue since it measures latent variables that cannot be directly observed. In addition, according to psychometrics, appropriate test requires a validation process before it can be effectively used as a measuring instrument. Thus, high quality tools for measuring student learning in Introductory Programming have been under-developed and under-researched. The objective of this work is to determine the psychometric properties (item validity, reliability, discrimination, difficulty, and distractors) of the developed multiple-choice questions of computational thinking in introductory programming by exploring classical test theory and item response theory which has not been deeply investigated by previous studies. The analysis results reveal that most of items are valid and the items are generally adequate reliable. In spite of the fact that some items are suggested to be revised since the item discrimination values, the distribution of difficulties, and distractor points are less than the expected threshold.",10.1109/e-Engineering47629.2021.9470593,IEEE,1.0,IEEE,assessment;computational thinking;introductory programming;psychometric properties,IEEE Conferences,UK,Nature Communications

Preliminary thinking about the mathematic foundation of modern computational electromagnetism,Yang Benluo; Li Shuguang,2008,"Computation of time-dependent electromagnetic field excited by a varying current distribution is the hardcore of modern computational electromagnetism. However, differing from other computing forms of field problem described by partial differential equations, the computation of electromagnetic field did not really use series of the general, abstract and formalized methods. And people have to construct forms of different models to make computation. Such a method of computation can also arrange forms particular propositions suitably. But, it cannot be regarded as a universal method and it is usually implicates some logic mistakes and physical distortion. The reason would be: time-dependent electromagnetic field lacks of a united mathematical physical model that can guarantee both the partial differential equations and boundary conditions consistent in logic. In reverse, if a general mathematical model is perfect in logic, it can not only allow us to effectively use the computation methods supplied by computational mathematics but also provide more full and more exact information about electromagnetic field.",10.1109/UWBUS.2008.4669406,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,logic;time-dependent electromagnetic field;exact mathematical model;computation,IEEE Conferences,USA,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
Teaching Computational Thinking to Multilingual Students through Inquiry-based Learning,S. Jacob; H. Nguyen; L. Garcia; D. Richardson; M. Warschauer,2020,"Central to the theory of learning are inquiry-based approaches to education. Whereas there is a plethora of research on inquiry learning in the domain of science [19], [20], few studies have analyzed how inquiry-based learning can be applied to computer science education, and how different approaches to inquiry may benefit diverse learners. This is one of the first studies to analyze teacher enactment of inquiry-based learning during the implementation of an upper elementary, computational thinking curriculum, and to explore how teacher approaches to inquiry appear to support or constrain multilingual students' development of computational thinking and computer science identities. Design-based research was used to iteratively develop, test, and refine the inquiry-based curriculum, which aligns with computer science and literacy standards, provides linguistic scaffolding, and integrates culturally responsive materials. We adopt a cross-case mixed-methods design to collect data from five teachers and 149 students including detailed field notes, teacher interviews, student computational artifacts, and student identity surveys. Through analyses of teacher moves, we find that teachers adopt different approaches to inquiry that can be indexed along a continuum ranging from open to closed. Patterns in student data revealed that those who received more structured inquiry lessons developed more sophisticated computational artifacts and showed greater identification with the field of computer science. Findings from this study are being used to add more structured inquiry approaches to the next iteration of our curriculum, including integrating USE/MODIFY/CREATE models into lessons and applying metacognitive strategies from reading research to students' programming activities.",10.1109/RESPECT49803.2020.9272487,IEEE,8.0,IEEE,inquiry-based learning;computer science;computational thinking;multilingual;English learners,IEEE Conferences,Italy,Journal of Computer Science

This will be carried out through the study of so called “moral machines,"" using a game-based learning approach on self-driving vehicles and the need to program such cars to perform certain behavior's under extreme situations. Students will be asked to logically base their reasoning on different ethical approaches and try to develop a schema of decision making that could serve to program a machine to respond to those situations. Students will also have to deal with the uncertainty of reaching solutions that will be debatable and not universally accepted as a part of the difficulty, more ethical than technical, to provide machines with the ability to take decisions where there is no such thing as a “right” versus “wrong” answer, and potentially both (or more) of the possible actions will bring unwanted consequences.",10.1109/RITA.2018.2809940,IEEE,10.0,IEEE,Computational thinking;decision making;game-based learning;ethics;logic;moral machines;self-driving car,IEEE Journals,Chile,ACM Transactions on Graphics

A novel interdisciplinary course in gerontechnology for disseminating computational thinking,H. -I. Yang; P. Martin; D. Satterfield; R. Babbitt; J. Wong; M. Shelley; C. K. Chang,2011,"While specialized knowledge and skills are the hallmark of modern society, the size and complexity of contemporary problems often require cooperative effort to analyze and solve. Therefore, experiences with skills, methodologies, and tools for effective interdisciplinary collaboration and structured problem solving are vital for preparing students for future academic and professional success. Meanwhile, computational systems have permeated much of modern professional and personal life, making computational thinking an essential skill for members of modern society. However, formal training in these techniques is primarily limited to students within computer science, mathematics, management of information systems, and engineering. At Iowa State University, we have designed and offered an experimental course to develop undergraduate students' abilities for interdisciplinary teamwork and to disseminate computational thinking skills to a broader range of students. This novel course was jointly designed and instructed by faculty from the Computer Science Department, Gerontology Program, and Graphic Design Program to incorporate diverse faculty expertise and pedagogical approaches. Students were required to interview real users to identify real-life problems, gather requirements, and assess candidate solutions, which necessitated communication both within the group and with technologically-disinclined users. In-class presentations and wiki-based project websites provided regular practice at disseminating domain expertise to larger interdisciplinary audiences. Workshops, group-based mentoring, peer learning, and guided discovery allowed non-CS majors to learn much more about computer programs and tools, and grading criteria held students individually accountable within their disciplines but also emphasized group collaboration",10.1109/FIE.2011.6142928,IEEE,5.0,IEEE,Computational thinking;Gerontechnology;Interdisciplinary;Teamwork,IEEE Conferences,China,Computers & Education

Towards Machines for Measuring Creativity: The Use of Computational Tools in Storytelling Activities,P. Karampiperis; A. Koukourikos; E. Koliopoulou,2014,"Until now, significant R&D effort in the field of Computational Creativity, has been devoted towards understudying the elements of the creative process from idea conception to production, or towards designing machines which exhibit human level creativity without merely mimicking the human creative process. However, in the effort to determine if an artefact is creative by human standards, it is also important to examine the perception of creativity by humans and to which extend this perception can be formalized and applied on the evaluation of creative works. In this paper, we investigate how the human perception for creativity exhibited in text artefacts can be predicted using appropriate formulations of computational creativity metrics. To this end, we designed and executed a storytelling experiment assisted by the usage of computational tools. We subsequently exploited human-provided rankings of the stories in order to train a model for evaluating creativity as a combination of various characteristics of the produced stories.",10.1109/ICALT.2014.150,IEEE,9.0,IEEE,Computational Creativity;Creativity Evaluation;Semantic Lateral Thinking;Computational Tools,IEEE Conferences,Argentina,Computers & Education
Supporting the development of multimodal writing and computational thinking skills through computer game creation,K. Howland,2009,"This abstract describes design-based research on building tools that support the development of skills which will allow learners to become producers rather than simply consumers of computational tools. Game creation is an activity which has good potential for learning skills such as multimodal writing and computational thinking skills. Existing tools make the creation of commercial quality games possible, but fall short of fulfilling the potential for skills development. Learner-centred design of a suite of tools which will guide learners towards activities with potential for the desired skills development is underway.

A container terminal logistics computational architecture with MPSoC distributed cooperative computing perspective,L. Bin,2015,"The systematic solutions to planning and scheduling for container terminal logistics systems (CTLS) have been scarce owing to their high complexity and strong randomness. This paper extended the past research on modeling CTLS with computer composition principles and architecture. The comparability and the further mapping relationships between CTLS and multi-processor system-on-chip (MPSoC) were discussed at great length within the theoretical viewpoints of computational thinking. Whereafter a container terminal logistics computational architecture was put forward for scheduling and execution using the perspective of MPSoC, which was established on the conceptual framework and fundamental principles of distributed, parallel, and cooperative computing in essence. Finally, the approach was demonstrated by investigating the stress testing, load balancing and process behavior of a typical container terminal logistics service case in contrast with the previous work based on the comprehensive computational experiments.",10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7261015,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,container terminal logistics;computational thinking;multi-processor system-on-chip;affinity;load balancing,IEEE Conferences,Japan,Journal of Computer Science
Perceiving Abstract Concepts Via Evolving Computational Cognitive Modeling,R. Sharma; B. Ribeiro; A. M. Pinto; F. A. Cardoso,2018,"Any cognizable thing (object, or idea) can be recognized as a concept, and they are usually described by modality-specific, experience-dependent, or localist-distributed representations. There has been a significant effort in studying concrete concepts, along with their underlying cognitive and psychological processes through conceptual representations produced by computational approaches (like Artificial Neural Networks). However, the notion of abstract concepts, though debated, is seldom explored. In this article, we propose an approach to learn abstract representation of concepts with Regulated Activation Networks (RANs) evolving computational modeling. RANs methodology is illustrated using a toydata problem, and evaluated for metrics Precision, Recall, Fl-score, and Accuracy, along with ROC curve analysis. RANs comparison is presented using a benchmark data from human activity recognition domain, yielding Precision= 98.20% (ca.), Recall= 97.62% (ca.), Fl-score= 97.8 (ca.), and Accuracy= 97.62% (ca.). Sleep Detection data from SOCIALITE project is used to model active and inactive students, showing a convincing performance.

GK-12 DISSECT: Incorporating computational thinking with K-12 science without computer access,R. Folk; G. Lee; A. Michalenko; A. Peel; E. Pontelli,2015,"Computational Thinking (CT) introduces computing concepts and demonstrates their usefulness in many other disciplines. CT principles such as algorithmic problem solving, abstraction, modeling and simulation, are integrated into existing STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) curricula by DISSECT (DIScover SciEnce through Computational Thinking). By pairing a local K-12 teacher with a graduate fellow, DISSECT provides instruction and resources as instruments that are pertinent to each specific discipline. These skills in problem-solving and abstract reasoning are necessary for students to be able to compete in the modern and future job markets. DISSECT works to provide these skill-sets to students and classrooms that lack access to computers. The K-12 teachers and graduate fellows work together to develop modules that are capable of teaching CT concepts that are directly tied to their current curriculum while removing the need for access to computer systems. This paper will focus on the modules developed and executed in middle and high school classrooms, emphasizing the creative ways explored to operate in a computer-free environment discussing the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, while qualitatively assessing student engagement, learning, and interaction which is gathered through teacher interviews, observations and informal talks with students.",10.1109/FIE.2015.7344238,IEEE,9.0,IEEE,Computational Thinking;K-12;Graduate Fellows,IEEE Conferences,Japan,ACM Transactions on Graphics
Natural Language Processing Algorithms for Divergent Thinking Assessment,H. Lee; W. Zhou; H. Bai; W. Meng; T. Zeng; K. Peng; S. Tong; T. Kumada,2023,"The manual assessment of creativity by human raters is coupled with unavoidable subjectivity and often costs much time and human resources. To address these issues, this paper explores how to apply natural language processing (NLP) methods to the assessment of creativity. Using the Alternative Use Task (AUT), participants were encouraged to generate ideas as fast as possible for a fixed time. It was hypothesized that the similarity of ideas would decrease over time in the AUT, considering the design fixation and the limitation of working memory. In the first study, 12 university students completed the AUT in paper-pencil form and generated a total of 376 responses. We applied two NLP models, namely BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and USE (Universal Sentence Encoder), to assess the similarity of responses between individuals. The results did not confirm our hypothesis. One prominent reason might be that the applied models represent millions of sentence structures that are over-ecological and too dissimilar to the sentence structures participants had used while finishing the AUT. Nevertheless, the results did show that BERT and USE could more accurately express the semantic information of responses pace with the Latent Semantic Analysis, a popular computer-aided model for AUT response assessment. In study 2, we proposed an algorithm to reanalyze the 376 responses in study 1 based on word embedding with crowdsourced responses. There were 1690 crowdsourced responses collected from 550 participants who completed an online version of the AUT. The results supported our hypothesis and showed that the similarity of responses increases as time passes. This indicates the proposed algorithm would alleviate the influence of sentence structure in AUT tasks. The differences between BERT, USE, and proposed algorithms are discussed in relation to the assessment of creativity, and the implications for future work are explored in-depth.",10.1109/ECEI57668.2023.10105336,IEEE,1.0,IEEE,Divergent Thinking Assessment;Natural Language Processing;Alternative Uses Task;Crowdsourcing,IEEE Conferences,USA,Journal of Computer Science
A Strategy for the Development of Computational Thinking from Game Design Specifications,K. Tavares Fernandes; M. Lucena; E. Aranha,2019,"Digital games are becoming more and more a part of our daily lives. After realizing this, several educators have been motivated to use games as teaching and learning tools. In this sense, it is possible to involve teachers and students in the production of their own games, thus contributing both to the development of computational thinking and to acquiring knowledge related to the different disciplines involved in this process. Despite the benefits, the production of games is a complex task that requires knowledge of a specific domain and presents a significant learning curve for students and teachers. The choice of using effective strategies such as Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) practices supported by a Controlled Natural Language (CNL) to promote the production of games in the educational context is decisive and can favor the adoption of game-based learning. This work proposes a strategy for the specification of game design for digital games by students and teachers in the classroom, that can promote the development of computational thinking, as well as reading and writing skills.",10.1109/ICALT.2019.00122,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,digital games;game design;computacional thinking;learning,IEEE Conferences,Mexico,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
Position: IntelliBlox: A Toolkit for Integrating Block-Based Programming into Game-Based Learning Environments,S. Taylor; W. Min; B. Mott; A. Emerson; A. Smith; E. Wiebe; J. Lester,2019,"Block-based programming languages reduce the need to learn low-level programming syntax while enabling novice learners to focus on computational thinking skills. Game-based learning environments have been shown to create effective and engaging learning experiences for students in a broad range of educational domains. The fusion of block-based programming with game-based learning offers significant potential to motivate learners to develop computational thinking skills. A key challenge educational game developers face in creating rich, interactive learning experiences that integrate computational thinking activities is the lack of an embeddable block-based programming toolkit. Current block-based programming languages, such as Blockly and Scratch, cannot be easily embedded into industry-standard 3D game engines. This paper presents IntelliBlox, a Blockly-inspired toolkit for the Unity cross-platform game engine that enables learners to create block-based programs within immersive game-based learning environments.

An Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic: A Psychometric Analysis,N. V. M. Diaz; D. A. Trytten; R. Meier; S. Y. Yoon,2021,"This research-track work-in-progress paper contributes to engineering education by documenting progress in developing a new standard Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic to measure engineering student success in five factors of computational thinking. Over the past year, results from an initial validation attempt were used to refine diagnostic questions. A second statistical validation attempt was then completed in Spring 2021 with 191 student participants at three universities. Statistics show that all diagnostic questions had statistically significant factor loadings onto one general computational thinking factor that incorporates the five original factors of (a) Abstraction, (b) Algorithmic Thinking, (c) Decomposition, (d) Data Representation and Organization, and (e) Impact of Computing. This result was unexpected as our goal was a diagnostic that could discriminate among the five factors. A small population size caused by the virtual delivery of courses during the COVID-19 pandemic may be the explanation and a third round of validation in Fall 2021 is expected to result in a larger population given the return to face-to-face instruction. When statistical validation is completed, the diagnostic will help institutions identify students with strong entry level skills in computational thinking as well as students that require academic support. The diagnostic will inform curriculum design by demonstrating which factors are more accessible to engineering students and which factors need more time and focus in the classroom. The long-term impact of a successfully validated computational thinking diagnostic will be introductory engineering courses that better serve engineering students coming from many backgrounds. This can increase student self-efficacy, improve student retention, and improve student enculturation into the engineering profession. Currently, the diagnostic identifies general computational thinking skill",10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637142,IEEE,2.0,IEEE,Diversity;engineering curriculum;computing knowledge;persistence;psychometric analysis,IEEE Conferences,Spain,Science Advances

Analysis of Sentiment Toward Computer Science in Pre-University Education,R. Herrero-Álvarez; E. Callejas-Castro; G. Miranda; C. León,2024,"Emotions are essential drivers of the learning process, influencing motivation, performance, and problem-solving abilities. In the field of Computer Science, students often struggle with negative emotions during programming activities, impacting their performance and project quality. To address this challenge, there is a growing need to introduce Computational Thinking skills at the pre-university level. This study focuses on understanding the emotions experienced by primary and secondary school students during Computational Thinking activities, involving both plugged and unplugged tools. A significant performance difference was observed between primary and secondary education levels, with the latter outperforming the former. The research identifies specific associations between concepts and emotions, highlighting age-related differences with younger students exhibiting more positive emotions. While gender-based disparities in Computer Science perception exist in secondary education, there are no corresponding distinctions in emotional responses. The study reveals a gender-based effect, with girls showing reduced emotional responses and lower Computational Thinking performance than boys. In summary, this research underscores the profound role of emotions in learning, providing essential insights for tailoring educational strategies considering gender-specific and programming concept-related factors.

Exploring the Interplay of Computational Thinking and Mathematics in Early Childhood Education: A Systematic Review,Y. Zhang; G. K. W. Wong,2024,"In recent years, educational research has emphasized the significance of computational thinking (CT) and mathematics knowledge acquisition for students' learning in engineering subjects. Pre-college education plays a crucial role in preparing students for future engineering learning. While the relationship between CT and mathematics has been extensively studied at the K-12 level, limited attention has been given to early childhood education (ECE) contexts. Our research aims to investigate the potential development of early CT through mathematics learning in a potentially reciprocal manner using developmentally appropriate educational tools and instructional approaches. To commence this exploration, our primary focus is to conduct a systematic review of existing empirical studies, synthesizing evidence to illuminate the interaction between CT and mathematics during early childhood. Using the seven powerful ideas from early CT proposed by Bers as the theoretical framework, our initial findings indicate that algorithms, hardware/software, and representation are the most studied CT competencies intersecting with early mathematics skills, including numerical and spatial knowledge, measurements, basic algebraical thinking, and data processing. The complex relationship between early CT and mathematics, in general, is also discussed. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that existing mathematics education in early childhood may foster the development of CT in young children. Although this study is preliminary, it serves as a valuable foundation for future research endeavors in uncovering the interdisciplinary nature of early CT within mathematics-integrated learning contexts, thus contributing to the advancement of this field.",10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578653,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Computational thinking;Mathematics;Early childhood education;STEM;STEAM,IEEE Conferences,Spain,PLOS ONE
Efficacy of a ‘Misconceiving’ Robot to Improve Computational Thinking in a Collaborative Problem Solving Activity: A Pilot Study,U. Norman; A. Chin; B. Bruno; P. Dillenbourg,2022,"Robot-mediated learning activities are often designed as collaborative exercises where children work together to achieve the activity objectives. Although miscommunications and misunderstandings occur frequently, humans, unlike robots, are very good at overcoming them and converging to a shared solution. With the aim of equipping a robot with these abilities and exploring its effects, in this article we investigate how a humanoid robot can collaborate with a human learner to construct a shared solution to a problem via suggesting actions and (dis)agreeing with each other. Concretely, we designed a learning activity aiming to improve the computational thinking skills of children, in which the robot makes suggestions on what to do, that may be in line with what the human thinks or not. Furthermore, the robot may suggest wrong actions that could essentially prevent them from finding a correct solution. Via a pilot study conducted remotely with 9 school children, we investigate whether the interaction results in positive learning outcomes, how the collaboration evolves, and how these relate to each other. The results show positive learning outcomes for the participants in terms of finding better solutions, suggesting that the collaboration with the robot might have helped trigger the learning mechanisms.",10.1109/RO-MAN53752.2022.9900775,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,human-robot interaction;mutual understanding;collaborative learning;computational thinking,IEEE Conferences,Canada,Journal of Computer Science
Koding4Kinder: Teaching Computational Thinking to Pupils Using a Combination of Programming and Electronics Platforms,N. Sharaf; G. Ahmed; A. Adel; S. Abdennadher; K.

President Obama once referred to the importance of children learning programming: “I do not want our young people to just be consumers, I want them to be producers of this technology and to understand it, to feel like they are controlling it, as opposed to it controlling them.” It is thus an increasing need for an individual to know how to write their own programs. With the increasing dependency on computation, one can anticipate such skills being a requirement for most jobs in the coming years. There is a lot of effort done in this area, however most of them focused on either software or hardware track.

Software clones in scratch projects: on the presence of copy-and-paste in computational thinking learning,G. Robles; J. Moreno-León; E. Aivaloglou; F. Hermans,2017,"Computer programming is being introduced in schools worldwide as part of a movement that promotes Computational Thinking (CT) skills among young learners. In general, learners use visual, block-based programming languages to acquire these skills, with Scratch being one of the most popular ones. Similar to professional developers, learners also copy and paste their code, resulting in duplication. In this paper we present the findings of correlating the assessment of the CT skills of learners with the presence of software clones in over 230,000 projects obtained from the Scratch platform. Specifically, we investigate i) if software cloning is an extended practice in Scratch projects, ii) if the presence of code cloning is independent of the programming mastery of learners, iii) if code cloning can be found more frequently in Scratch projects that require specific skills (as parallelism or logical thinking), and iv) if learners who have the skills to avoid software cloning really do so. The results show that i) software cloning can be commonly found in Scratch projects, that ii) it becomes more frequent as learners work on projects that require advanced skills, that iii) no CT dimension is to be found more related to the absence of software clones than others, and iv) that learners -even if they potentially know how to avoid cloning- still copy and paste frequently. The insights from this paper could be used by educators and learners to determine when it is pedagogically more effective to address software cloning, by educational programming platform developers to adapt their systems, and by learning assessment tools to provide better evaluations.",10.1109/IWSC.2017.7880506,IEEE,30.0,IEEE,,IEEE Conferences,USA,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering

Working on their own research problems allows students to go through the entire research cycle, which promotes not only subject and methodological competencies but also the students' self-competencies. The handling of subject-specific and didactic challenges of this form of teaching-learning has been discussed many times in the past. New challenges for research-based learning now arise from the shift of teaching and learning to virtual space associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper focuses on the adaptation of a research-based teaching-learning format to the demands of e-learning in the course Interaction Science with Artificial Intelligence. We evaluated the adapted teaching-learning format with 18 students in a master's program in STEM. The students stated an increase in professional competence in the areas of programming, data preparation and data visualization.

The Waste Separation Game to Promote Computational Thinking Through Mixed Reality Technology,W. Phatarametravorakul; S. Cheevanantaporn; P. Jamsri,2022,"The primary issue of garbage is its direct impact on the environment and quality of life. Several types of trash have piled up in Thailand. Many individuals don’t use the correct way of waste management because they have lacked knowledge and understanding of how to sort rubbish since childhood. To increase the possibility to fully utilize the knowledge of waste separation correctly, the researcher aims to promote computational thinking through the learning of a game called “Trashman”. This game simulates various objects for situations of sorting garbage into the appropriate sorting bin. Trashman has 3 levels in the game. Each level increases the number of bins and the amount of garbage, starting from level 1-3 which refers to easy, moderate, and difficult levels, respectively. The level indicates the error of separating the waste if putting it into a wrong bin type. The educating about different types of waste separation through the game utilizes Mixed Reality (MR) technology of the Magic Leap One device. The developer’s expectation for an alternative learning medium in the form of a game is to allow players to apply their knowledge by practicing computational skills by sorting garbage correctly.

Engineering and Computational Thinking talent in middle school students: A framework for defining and recognizing student affinities,J. Cross; E. Hamner; L. Zito; I. Nourbakhsh,2016,"In this paper we describe our process for synthesizing frameworks for recognizing student talents in the areas of Computational Thinking (CT) and Engineering Design (ED) from prior research. Computer science education research has resulted in multiple, overlapping definitions of CT as an approach towards solving problems using methods and tools that are derived from computer science. Our development of operationalized definitions of CT talent for middle school educators is focused on uniting models for CT in a simplified structure. Our ED definition framework builds on multiple distinct models of the engineering design process along with concepts from systems engineering models and the design thinking process. We operationalize these frameworks to provide teachers with metrics and examples for recognizing and assessing the CT and ED skills of their students in non-technical classes. By training teachers to evaluate students' processes from the perspective of an engineer and computer scientist, teachers are more able to help their STEM-inclined students recognize the alignments between their own talents and possible careers. Through the analysis of teacher surveys and interviews from 19 classroom implementations, we evaluated the changes that the Arts & Bots program has had on teacher perceptions of student CT and ED skills and talents.",10.1109/FIE.2016.7757720,IEEE,14.0,IEEE,transdisciplinary;middle school;engineering pipeline;underrepresentation;educational robotics,IEEE Conferences,USA,Journal of Computer Science
Algorithmic Expressions for Assessing Algorithmic Thinking Ability of Elementary School Children,Y. Oomori; H. Tsukamoto; H. Nagumo; Y. Takemura; K. Iida; A. Monden; K. -i. Matsumoto,2019,"This Research to Practice Full Paper presents the development of the algorithmic expressions for the assessment tools for assessing algorithmic thinking ability of elementary school children. In Japan, elementary school children will be required to learn computer programming as an interdisciplinary element appearing throughout the curriculum in 2020. The purpose of this programming education is to nurture Computational Thinking (CT) for elementary school children in Japan. However, almost no discussion has been conducted in Japan on how to measure the level of CT an elementary school child has acquired. Since the definition of CT is not very firm, it is not easy to measure the levels of CT. Therefore, several organizations have issued operational definitions of CT. Among the concepts of CT in those operational definitions, Algorithmic Thinking was chosen as a representative of CT, and the assessment tools for evaluating Algorithmic Thinking ability have been developed in this research. The assessment tool was conducted in the experimental Computer Science Unplugged classes and in the control classes in two elementary schools in Japan. There were in total 152 children in the classes, and all of them were 5th grade children. By answering the questions in the assessment tool, each child got a score between 0 and 15. The scores were statistically analyzed.",10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028486,IEEE,1.0,IEEE,algorithmic thinking;algorithmic expression;assessment;elementary school children,IEEE Conferences,Brazil,ACM Transactions on Graphics

Commonsense Knowledge as the Glue in a Hybrid Model of Computational Creativity,A. Gomez De Silva Garza; E. Cambria; R. Perez y Perez,2014,"In this paper, we describe on-going work on the ensemble of two models for computational creativity using commonsense knowledge. The GENCAD model of computational creativity proposes the use of an evolutionary algorithm (EA) that employs a population of exemplars as a starting point for its search, unlike traditional EAs, which employ a randomly-generated initial population. The EA, operating on this population, is then used to generate new potentially creative solutions. GENCAD has been instantiated in the domains of structural design of tall buildings and feng shui-compliant residential floor-plan design. The MEXICA model of computational creativity also begins with a set of exemplars as a starting point, but it analyzes these exemplars based on a domain theory. The generalized model that is obtained from analyzing the set of exemplars is then used to guide the generation of new solutions. MEXICA has been instantiated in the domain of plot generation for stories involving themes, characters and locations from the Mexica culture of ancient Mexico. In the hybrid model, we combine the two original models to generate plots for stories of the same sort that MEXICA generates, but using GENCAD's process model to do so. To confirm that the generated plots make sense, the hybrid model integrates commonsense knowledge into its evaluation module.",10.1109/ICDMW.2014.178,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Commonsense knowledge;computational creativity;plot analysis and generation,IEEE Conferences,Italy,Science Advances
Approaches For Automation In Assisting Evaluator For Grading Of Answer Scripts: A Survey,R. G. Patil; S. Z. Ali,2018,"Student who possess several qualities of intelligence and critical thinking skills are believed to think independently. To develop overall skills for a student, it is required that a student demonstrate his knowledge, skills, and abilities in a various ways i.e., through multiple choice questions, fill the gaps, problem solving, short and long answers. Assessment of short and long/essay answers is hectic and tedious tasks for several teachers. Learning Management Systems provide an opportunity to learn online. To develop critical thinking in an online environment, it is necessary to conduct exams and assessment online. Most online LMS tools support assessment through multiple choice questions, but these tools test only higher order thinking skills. Many researchers have tried to provide a system to automatically assess short and long/essay answers using several different approaches. The objective of survey is to highlight problems associated with the evaluator, discuss difficulties and limitations of online tools. In this literature, the methodologies used to develop various models of short answer grading given by several authors and their results are discussed.

Critical Systems Thinking,M. C. Jackson,2024,"Summary <p>Critical Systems Thinking (CST) is a systems approach that aims to assist decision‐makers to better understand and address the complex issues they face. This chapter looks at the origins and early development of CST. A brief account of the state of Systems Thinking (ST) in the early 1980s is necessary to discern the reasons for the emergence of the approach. The development of CST is then traced to 1991. By that time, it had become formalised around a set of three commitments, to which it has largely remained true. The first, ‘systemic critique’, insists that all systems approaches are partial, and this leads to their different strengths and weaknesses. The second, ‘systemic pluralism’, suggests that the maximum benefit can be obtained by using systems methodologies in combination during an intervention. The third, ‘systemic improvement’, explains what improvement means in systems terms and how it can be pursued. The case is then made for CST to embrace a fourth commitment, to ‘systemic pragmatism’. It is argued that this can support the other three and take CST forward.</p>",10.1002/9781394203604.ch3,Wiley,0.0,IEEE,,Wiley Telecom eBook Chapters,Chile,Journal of Computer Science

Examining theoretical and pedagogical foundations of computational thinking in the context of higher education,F. J. Agbo; S. T. Yigzaw; I. T. Sanusi; S. S. Oyelere; A. H. Mare,2021,"This research paper examined theories, pedagogics, and contents explored by studies focusing on promoting computational thinking (CT) in higher education institutions (HEIs). CT has become a fundamental approach to building problem-solving skills, which requires a thought process. The field of CT is generally still maturing, and the use of CT as an approach to introduce freshmen to introductory programming courses in HEIs has been gaining scholars' interest in the recent past. To appreciate the strategies explored to promote teaching and learning of CT in HEIs; evaluate scholarly discussions, contributions, and potential impact of studies in this field, there is a need to ground the theoretical constructs that build the foundation for the field. A literature review methodology was adopted in this study. The data collected from the Web of Science, the Scopus, ACM, and ProQuest databases were analyzed to provide answers to the research questions. The findings from this study suggest that constructionism and constructivism are the prevailing learning theories explored by scholars in this field to deploy CT in HEI. Additionally, the study revealed that activity-based learning, problem-based learning, automatic assessment-based learning, and self-regulated or self-reflective learning are the prominent pedagogies used by educators. These findings provided a strong foundation for research in this growing field.

When Does Collaborative Interaction Support Learning of Computational Thinking Among Undergraduate Students,B. Chowdhury; D. Kafura; A. Johri,2022,"Collaborative learning has proven to be a productive approach across domains including computer science. Especially for novices, collaboration among learners with diverse experiences, values, and knowledge can be especially effective. However, there is limited research on how collaborative interactions among learners from different undergraduate disciplines manifest during the learning of computational concepts. This qualitative study investigates interaction among learners in small interdisciplinary student groups in an undergraduate computational thinking (CT) class. In analyzing the social interactions of cohort members, the Differentiating Overt Learning Activities (DOLA) framework developed by Chi was used as a starting point. Several themes (e.g. explain-to-other, self-monitor, connect/plan) suggested by Chi’s overt activities framework emerged naturally in the observations. However, several categories that were not explicitly stated in the DOLA framework also emerged. These are: asking a shallow question versus asking an elaborate question, socializing, being confused or expressing frustration, self-talk, and struggle. Analysis of interactions between cohort members revealed that most of the group interactions were active in nature. Barriers to collaborative learning were accentuated when peers were novices. Students who lacked knowledge of computational concepts found it hard to contribute to a discussion, hindering learning, whereas students who had better conceptual understanding were constructive in their interactions, elaborated on a topic, made connections with previous problems, and displayed self-awareness about their understanding.",10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962505,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Computational Thinking;Collaboration;Undergraduate Instruction;Qualitative Research;Data Science,IEEE Conferences,Mexico,Nature Communications

In essence, it is considered a cross-disciplinary STEM field, advancing the philosophy of Quantum Literacy (QL), which addresses the transdisciplinary nature of real world complex problems. QL addresses the challenges of learning and skills acquisition, through specific computing activities, within a highly bounded discipline and of access to the kind of powerful knowledge that should be more accessible to a wide group of learners. It is therefore important that quantum computing and quantum technologies knowledge is accessible to students and teachers who work with real problems, in a more inclusive and interactive way. In this paper, we argue for the necessity of exposing students to new and powerful quantum tools, as provided by cutting edge quantum computing technologies. We do that by proposing contemporary and STEM related activities and gamification scenarios, in which they acquire stronger mathematical and computational - problem decomposition and modelling skills, working as real researchers. By engaging students in games and activities related to quantum computing and quantum information processing, they acquire all necessary knowledge related to: superposition, teleportation, entanglement, quantum gates and quantum information. The serious games proposed in this paper relates to quantum strategic games, necessary for STEM activities to train students within the computational thinking 2.0 framework. All scenarios were implemented using the didactic model of inquiry-based learning using Python libraries.",10.1109/EDUCON54358.2023.10125266,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Quantum Games;Quantum Literacy;Computational Thinking 2.0;Python,IEEE Conferences,Canada,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
Using Topic Modeling to Extract Pre-Service Teachers’ Understandings of Computational Thinking From Their Coding Reflections,M. Cutumisu; Q. Guo,2019,"Contribution: This paper employs the automatic scoring of short essays as a novel way to determine pre-service teachers' knowledge of and attitudes toward computational thinking (CT) from their written reflections. Implications about designing CT courses for pre-service teachers are discussed. Background: CT is an essential 21st-century competency that supports the development of problem-solving skills. Inspired by computing science problem-solving practices, CT should transcend disciplines, but few universities or colleges include CT courses or CT content in their core courses. It is also difficult to know what pre-service teachers think about CT and their role in promoting it. Research Questions: Do pre-service teachers' coding reflections reveal any important information about their knowledge of, skills in, and attitudes toward CT? Methodology: Traditional qualitative techniques based on human raters are impractical in analyzing hundreds of essays. Topic modeling, an unsupervised machine learning modeling technique, was employed to extract topical features from participants' reflections. In one section of an undergraduate Introduction to Educational Technology course offered at a large university in Western Canada, n = 139 pre-service teachers wrote a short reflection on their experience following a 20 h Accelerated Intro to Computer Science Code.org course. Topics were identified by analyzing contextual trends in participants' written reflections. Findings: Results showed that pre-service teachers' reflections included CT concepts, practices, and perspectives. Specifically, participants connected the coding activity to prior knowledge and experiences.",10.1109/TE.2019.2925253,IEEE,21.0,IEEE,Computational thinking;computing skills;educational technology;higher education;pre-service teachers;problem solving;programming;topic modeling,IEEE Journals,Germany,Computers & Education
Research to Practice: Keeping STEM student recruitment fresh and relevant using peer mentoring,J. I. Clark,2020,"This work in progress paper in the research-to-practice category focuses on high school students planning to enter a new learning environment for transition. Prospective students benefit from structured programming that considers two factors. First, the college knowledge required to navigate day-to-day logistics including new living arrangements, supporting physical & mental health, and funding the experience. Second, STEM curricula and challenges students from extremely rural communities face in identifying with these rigorous programs. The work of influential researchers in student transition and retention along with contextual findings from a large, rural state in the Rocky Mountain region informed the redesign of an engineering college's outreach program. This paper has two purposes. First, it details how established theories combined with research findings and assessment can create robust models to support keeping recruitment programs relevant. Second, it provides an example of how a model was developed and then used to redesign and assess an outreach program using college peer mentors to support high school-aged students interested in engineering and computing disciplines.",10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274230,IEEE,1.0,IEEE,research-to-practice;outreach program design;design thinking;computational thinking;backward design;Next Generation STEM;pracademic approach,IEEE Conferences,India,Computers & Education

Low-dose computed tomography (CT)screening has been shown to significantly reduce lung cancer mortality but suffers from a high false positive rate that leads to unnecessary diagnostic procedures. The development of deep learning techniques has the potential to help improve lung cancer screening technology. Here we present the algorithm, DeepScreener, which can predict a patient's cancer status from a volumetric lung CT scan. DeepScreener is based on our model of Spatial Pyramid Pooling, which ranked 16th of 1972 teams (top 1 percent)in the Data Science Bowl 2017 competition (DSB2017), evaluated with the challenge datasets. Here we test the algorithm with an independent set of 1449 low-dose CT scans of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST)cohort, and we find that DeepScreener has consistent performance of high accuracy. Furthermore, by combining Spatial Pyramid Pooling and 3D Convolution, it achieves an AUC of 0.892, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art algorithms using only 3D convolution.

Introductory Engineering Courses With Computational Thinking: The Impact of Educational Privilege and Engineering Major Entry Policy on Student Pathways,N. V. Mendoza Diaz; D. A. Trytten; R. Meier,2022,This research category paper examines the impact of computational thinking within first-year engineering courses on student pathways into engineering. Computational thinking and programming appear in many introductory engineering courses. Prior work found that early computational thinking development is critical to the formation of engineers. This qualitative research paper extends the research by documenting how pre-university privileges impact first-year student trajectories into engineering through a qualitative examination of student interviews from three institutions with different processes for matriculation into engineering majors. We identify the underlying assumptions of meritocracy that are concealing the role of educational privilege in selecting which engineering students will be allowed to join the field. We provide a suggestion for how institutions can include computational thinking in introductory engineering courses with less risk of furthering the marginalization of students with few academic privileges.,10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962501,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,diversity;computational thinking;first year curriculum;persistence;matriculation,IEEE Conferences,Brazil,Journal of Computer Science

Wong,2018,"This paper investigates how to increase understanding of design and sustainable systems by scaffolding cognitive access and transfer of learning using eclectic approaches to experiment with networks of design potentials. Cognitive access simulates multi-criteria case indexing, refined from knowledge induction derived from analyses of random but related cases based on search strategies. Randomization of the search space encourages emergence of heuristic solutions, fuzzy though informed transfers and further refinement of schema. We investigate the type of navigational structures/design resulting from creative reuse/refactoring and lean management; and whether there will be evidences of knowledge induction from randomized search scaffolded by Case-based Reasoning (CBR), which leads to heuristic transfer and learning. Examples from two courses carried out August-December 2017 within the participatory design-agile framework for engagement in Smart Cities are assessed for creative reuse regarding: a) people, process and tools; b) domain engineering; c) component mining and d) open source vs. systematic reuse.

Making a Case for Studying the Effects of Using GitHub on HBCU Students' Computational Thinking Skills,A. E. Johnson,2021,"While preparing students for careers beyond graduation, HBCU faculty often have to balance the priorities of bridging the gap between the level of student preparation and the expected level of preparedness as influenced by industry and discipline standards. Prioritization of these standards does not always align with the experience of students at Historically Black College and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSI). The Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) 2013 Computer Science Curricula guidelines highlight version control as one of many core tools in the Social Issues and Professional Practice (SP) Knowledge Area students should experience in their upper-level software engineering courses. Research has demonstrated that at this level, students receive exposure to the tool but are not able to gain sufficient mastery. Other researchers have advocated for version control being introduced earlier in the computer science curricula. There is limited research that indicates that this particular tool improves the learning outcomes for students or significantly complements the other ACM Knowledge Areas.

Most of these books offer a learning path based on the experience of the experts who author them. In this paper we propose and investigate an alternative way of determining the most suitable learning paths by analyzing projects developed by learners hosted in public repositories. Therefore, we downloaded 250 projects of different types from the Scratch online platform, and identified the differences and clustered them based on a quantitative measure, the computational thinking score provided by Dr. Scratch. We then triangulated the results by qualitatively studying in detail the source code of the prototypical projects to explain the progression required to move from one cluster to the next one. The result is a data-driven itinerary that can support teachers and policy makers in the creation of a curriculum for learning to program. Aiming to generalize this approach, we discuss a potential recommender tool, populated with data from public repositories, to allow educators and learners creating their own learning paths, contributing thus to a personalized learning connected with students' interests.",10.1109/TETC.2017.2734818,IEEE,33.0,IEEE,Programming;computational thinking;learning paths;data-driven;Scratch,IEEE Journals,Australia,Nature Communications

Modeling a Problem-Solving Approach Through Computational Thinking for Teaching Programming,Z. -A. Tareq; R. J. Raja Yusof,2024,"Contribution: A problem-solving approach (PSA) model derived from major computational thinking (CT) concepts. This model can be utilized to formulate solutions for different algorithmic problems and translate them into effective active learning methods. Background: Different teaching approaches for programming are widely available; however, being able to formulate an algorithmic solution computationally and then transform it into code is essential for students. Research Questions: What are the effective teaching approaches for fostering the development of problem-solving and programming skills? How do CT concepts contribute to the formulation of a PSA model for programming problems and its translation into an effective teaching method? How can an effective teaching method that utilizes the PSA model be identified and distinguished from other approaches? Methodology: A preliminary study pointed out the difficulties experienced when teaching programming, inspiring the formulation of a PSA model that used CT concepts. An experimental study on problem-based and game-based programming workshops that utilized the PSA model through sorting algorithms was performed on experimental groups consisting of 30 students each. A syntax-based programming workshop consisting of 30 students was used as the control group. All the participants were recruited through a pretest that incorporated basic programming questions. The participants had to answer a posttest after the workshop. Findings: The results showed that the participants exhibited no significant difference between the pretest and posttest for the syntax-based learning (SBL). However, there is a significant difference between the pretest and posttest of both the problem-based learning (PBL) and the game-based learning (GBL) workshops.

Effects of gender and abstract thinking factors on adolescents' computer program learning,C. J. Park; J. S. Hyun; J. Heuilan,2015,"Computational thinking ability is important in computer science education. It emphasizes abstraction and automation. For automation, programming has become a key ability in digital society recently. As a result, the increase in the importance of coding education in many countries has brought various educational methods to improve teenagers' programming abilities. Among programming abilities, reading ability is important especially to programming novices. This paper focuses on the effects of gender and abstract thinking abilities of adolescents on understanding computer programs. Also, we examine if there is any difference in teaching between adolescents and college students. In order to achieve our research goals, we surveyed on the abstract thinking level, and then measured program understanding ability for 300 academic high school students who had learned C language. From this research, we found that the abstract thinking affects more complex program understanding positively. Also, we found that the language experience before learning brought the difference in program understanding. However, we could not find statistical differences in program understanding between two genders. From this research, we can provide a new point of view to improve adolescents' programming ability with abstract thinking and gender factors.",10.1109/FIE.2015.7344115,IEEE,1.0,IEEE,computer science education;computer programming understanding;abstract thinking;gender difference;software metric,IEEE Conferences,India,Science Advances

CT is the focus of ongoing debate about the future of computing in schools, and this poses a number of challenges. Early discussions on the topic were plagued by vague and all-encompassing definitions of the term, which raised awareness of a need for school learning focused on emerging computational systems and their impact on society and the lives of citizens, but failed to address what should actually be included in the revised curricula. As some of those issues have been addressed, a number of problems remain. This paper analyses some recent and future developments in the field of computing, and expands the discussion on the vexed question of the nature and limits of computational thinking. We ask whether the current mainstream literature and curriculum for CT is well positioned in terms of the future towards which computing is heading.

Ahli,2019,"Effective application of contextual learning can be facilitated by providing opportunity to students to use the knowledge in concept learnt, to solve certain problems within a `context'. To improve student engagement in quantitative based course like Math, Accounting or Science; it is of supreme importance that students are able to make connections between knowledge and its application to a real world context. Two such cases of Contextual Learning have been presented in this paper which was modeled in implementation of interdisciplinary projects across Accounting and IT disciplines, with Business students enrolled in Managerial Accounting and Cost Accounting courses and CIS students in Mobile Application course and ICT. This study aims at presenting a contextual strategy used to enhance Accounting and IT skills in Undergraduate students at Dubai Women's College, Higher Colleges of Technology. We posited that through this contextualized approach, students would see Accounting, Computational thinking and app development as tools for solving work-related problems. Using Constructivist teaching and REACT (relating, experience, application, collaboration and transfer) strategy; we initiated curriculum integration of both Accounting and IT, which deviates from traditional teaching model where learning of a subjects is isolated from any context. We conclude that the interdisciplinary projects implemented were a robust technique for application of contextual learning. The most important outcome was achieving the highest level in bloom's taxonomy and that is to `create'.",10.1109/ICASET.2019.8714444,IEEE,1.0,IEEE,Contextual Learning;REACT;Computational Thinking;Cost Volume Profit;Team Based Learning;Peer Led Team Learning,IEEE Conferences,India,PLOS ONE

Unconscious decision minds and divergent thinking model,Z. Wang,2017,"This paper presents measure-valued Markov decision processes (MVMDPs) and gives an algorithm of finding an optimal policy for this model. MVMDP is a generalization of partially observable Markov decision process, and reflects an important characteristic of human thought: that people, under the possibility that they grasp the whole states (i.e., appropriately measure the state space), think of problems and can choose their own optimal actions. So the measure-valued Markov decision process is the conscious result of unconscious decision minds. Moreover, we extend this thought to the category of divergent thinking and presents measure-valued Markov process model which is based on the measure-valued branching process in modern probability theory. This model can depict the unconscious mind feature that is: the way of human thinking is not linear, like logical mind; on the contrary, the mind has a grasp of the whole problem and evolves in an “area” manner; in this way, the mind can always get the heart of problems. We believe this work is helpful for further development of artificial intelligence.",10.1109/FSKD.2017.8393054,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Measure-Valued Branching Processes;Measure-Valued Markov Decision Processes;Partially observable Markov Decision Processes,IEEE Conferences,Brazil,PLOS ONE

Applications of Machine Learning to Form-giving in Industrial Design,H. -H. Wang,2022,"Machine learning is a key technology to design and develop products, systems, and even services. In particular, image classification using deep learning has been successfully applied to many fields. Although industrial designers might learn this is an opportunity for their best practice, studies demonstrating how to integrate the technology into the design process are rare. Thus, we discussed the need to introduce ML to industrial design by presenting examples and ML tools with lower scientific thresholds such as Weka that is preferable for industrial design students and practitioners. A five-stage process of applying ML to product form-giving is presented to illustrate the bridging of ML to the design process. Further technical details and industry case studies are needed to demonstrate evidence of the advantages of ML in form-giving.

Entitled “CT Pathways” for short, the three-year research practitioner partnership (RPP) is a collaboration between Digital Promise Global, Digital Promise, and the League of Innovative Schools, a national network of 101 school districts across 33 states, serving over 3 million students. The goal of CT Pathways is to design, investigate and improve inclusive computing pathways for all K-12 students, starting in elementary school and going through high school. In this RPP, researchers join with three “Core” districts and twelve “Pilot” districts from the League of Innovative Schools to focus on districts’ Hispanic and African American students, Title 1 schools and, more generally, their girls and low-income students. The poster presentation will focus on the first of CT Pathways’ three research questions: How do individual participating League districts define the purpose (“the why”) of CS and CT education, and how do these individual rationales subsequently inform respective district’s intention to offer their students more equitable access to CS/CT content (“the how”)? Results will be reported via baseline pre-survey results from district administrators as well as through follow-up interviews/discussions with select district leads. At this early stage, the primary goal is to help districts align the economic and digital literacy rationales for CS/CT education with the wider social justice and broadening participation considerations they have identified.",10.1109/RESPECT46404.2019.8985843,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,computational thinking;CSforAll;equity;computer science pathways,IEEE Conferences,France,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering

CT4All: Enhancing Computational Thinking Skills in Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders,R. Munoz; T. Schumacher Barcelos; R. Villarroel,2018,"Computational Thinking (CT) has been identified in the last few years as a fundamental skill that should be developed by all people. This has motivated multiple initiatives, whether governmental, through organizations, or by individuals. However, upon realizing a literature review, to the best of our knowledge no initiatives that include minority groups such as those within the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) were proposed. Furthermore, in this context there are no guidelines to orientate the creation of didactic activities that will bring about the benefits of CT. Due to the aforementioned information, in this article we present the definition of a collection of guidelines for the construction of didactic activities (CT4AII) that aim to promote Computational Thinking in adolescents with ASD through the construction of digital games. The proposed guidelines were instantiated in a Digital Games Programming Workshop with Scratch. The workshop was offered to four adolescents with ASD, obtaining the development of high-level CT skills and stimulating interpersonal skills that are diminished in this public. Furthermore, a posttest was executed 5 months later, with the objective of determining if the developed skills had been maintained over time. The results evidenced that the skills were in fact maintained in a sustained manner, demonstrating promising results.",10.1109/TLA.2018.8358673,IEEE,3.0,IEEE,autism spectrum disorders;computational thinking;game design workshop;neurodiversity,IEEE Journals,USA,Journal of Machine Learning Research

Assessing Learning Behavior and Cognitive Bias from Web Logs,R. J. Rao; C. Stewart; A. Perez; S. M. Renganathan,2018,"This research to practice, work in progress paper presents the analysis strategy used to assess the learning behavior using logs on an e-learning platform. Students who can link algebraic functions to their corresponding graphs perform well in STEM courses. Early algebra curricula teaches these concepts in tandem. However, it is challenging to assess whether students are linking the concepts. Video analyses, interviews and other traditional methods that aim to quantify how students link the concepts taught in school require precious classroom and teacher time. We use web logs to infer learning. Web logs are widely available and amenable to data science. Our approach partitions the web interface into components related to data and graph concepts. We collect click and mouse movement data as users interact with these components. We used statistical and data mining techniques to model their learning behavior. We built our models to assess learning behavior for a workshop presented in Summer 2016. Students in the workshop were middle-school math teachers planning to use this curriculum in their own classrooms. We used our models to assess participation levels, a prerequisite indicator for learning. Our models aligned with ground-truth traditional methods for 17 of 18 students.

Double-Assimilation of Prosperity and Destruction Oriented Improved Imperialist Competitive Algorithm with Computational Thinking,B. Li; Z. Tang,2022,"Whereas the imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) shows limited global search ability and be liable to be trapped into local optimum, a double-assimilation of prosperity and destruction oriented improved imperialist competitive algorithm (DPDO-IIC A) is proposed tentatively to overcome inherent defects. The imperialist assimilation and colonial reform strategy are customized purposefully, and a novel population redistribution mechanism is introduced as well. The three improvement measures are supposed to further promote population diversity and searching accuracy. The CEC2017 test set is selected to verify the performance of the DPDO-IICA by the different types of numerical function problems with the different dimensions. Moreover, the DPDO-IICA is compared with the three first-class intelligent optimization algorithms, which have achieved significant rankings in the CEC2017 competition. The comparison shows that the DPDO-IICA has good performances, which is demonstrated by the accuracy and stability. In addition, the proportion of imperialists and colonies is investigated, and it is through the community partitioning and clustering dynamically to enhance the population diversity. In conclusion, the DPDO-IICA can effectively improve the ability of global exploration and avoid premature convergence in comparison with the original ICA.",10.1109/CEC55065.2022.9870296,IEEE,1.0,IEEE,imperialist competitive algorithm;computational thinking;double assimilation;prosperity and destruction of empires;population redistribution;elite opposition-based learning;differential evolution operator;partitioning and clustering,IEEE Conferences,China,Journal of Computer Science
"Thinking, expertise and diagrams that encode laws",P. C. . -H. Cheng,1996,"Among diagrammatic representations, law encoding diagrams (LEDs) are a special class. A LED captures the important laws or relations of a domain in the structure of a diagram using geometrical, spatial and topological constraints, such that a single instantiation of a diagram represents one instance of a phenomenon. Research on LEDs uses a combination of approaches, including the analysis of properties, computational modelling and empirical studies. The overarching theoretical context of this work is the paradigm of complex information processing, which sees problem solving as symbol processing by the means of heuristic searching. This paper considers how different LEDs can be used to solve diverse problems, and contrasts them to common Cartesian graphs, to argue that LEDs may be useful representations for expert problem solving. LEDs seem to be able to support some of the abilities that experts appear to possess, such as: being able to perceive large meaningful patterns; solving problems fast and with little error; seeing problems at a deep level; and doing large amounts of qualitative analysis of problems. Various forms of problem solving are examined in a particular domain, using different LEDs and conventional graphs. One LED and some sample problems are described.

Game-Based Assessment for Computational Thinking: A Systematic Review,Q. Luo; S. Zhang,2024,"Computational thinking (CT) has become an indispensable skill in the 21st century and has permeated into K-12 education at all levels. The evaluation of CT has become a crucial concern for educators and researchers. Currently., while extensive research has investigated the assessment of students' CT conceptual understanding., the measurement of their thinking processes is less involved. The game-based assessment appears to address this issue by analyzing students' behaviors and reactions during the gameplay process., which has become an emerging assessment tool in CT education. This drives the need for a comprehensive overview of this field. To fill this gap., this study aims to conduct a systematic literature review on the assessment of CT through games. It explores CT skills assessed through games., focusing on target groups, game forms., and benefits. A total of fifteen studies were examined. Findings indicate that algorithmic thinking, problem decomposition, pattern recognition., and abstraction were commonly assessed in games. Different ways for assessing CT skills in games were identified, involving progression level, log data, and manual coding. The benefits of CT game-based assessments were broadly reported, such as enjoyable experiences for students, instant feedback, easy administration for teachers and researchers, and richer information on students' cognitive processes. However, limited has been done in exploring the use of digital games for younger age groups, and the psychometric qualities of the tools were hardly reported in the reviewed studies.

Garaizar,2014,"The popularization of digital educational devices with low barriers to entry has encouraged the development of many training activities oriented towards the incorporation of technology in schools. In some cases, the introduction of technology has led to the development of new educational practices that support the development of computational thinking. However, the supposed benefits of these approaches have not been properly assessed. Moreover, having taught over 30 workshops with the Scratch programming tool to teachers at different educational levels (primary, secondary, university), we found no evidence of subsequent methodological changes in schools. This study tries to understand the dissonance between the alleged success of initiatives around digital literacy and the lack of continuity in the use of user-friendly programming environments like Scratch. For this purpose, we analyzed the evolution of the grades of Scratch programming achieved by the students of the School of Education of Vitoria-Gasteiz and their engagement with Scratch. We also interviewed teachers from different schools who have participated in Scratch workshops with us. After this study, we identified some of the circumstances that facilitate and hinder the development of computational thinking. Since we consider Scratch as a resource that allows the development of new methodological approaches in the classroom as well as the acquisition of skills related to computational thinking, we propose a framework that will help to overcome the current status.",10.1109/FIE.2014.7044224,IEEE,3.0,IEEE,computational thinking;digital literacy;education;programming;Scratch,IEEE Conferences,Spain,ACM Transactions on Graphics
Active Learning to Develop Key Research Skills in Master's Level Computer Science Coursework,S. L. Hepner; T. E. Carlson,2018,"This paper provides insights from a preliminary study on how embedding critical academic literacy skills using active learning strategies in a small Master's level computer science course might impact student performance, skills development, and engagement. One goal of higher education is to develop students' critical thinking and research skills. Prior work suggests these skills are best taught explicitly, when they are embedded in the curriculum, using active learning strategies, and using recent high-quality research as a basis for inquiry. Using multiple methods, this paper examines how teaching critical academic literacy skills through active learning strategies impacts student critical thinking ability and engagement. Results suggest substantial student engagement and improvements in critical literacy skills.",10.1109/TALE.2018.8615196,IEEE,4.0,IEEE,active learning;blended classroom;critical thinking;critical academic literacy;master's level;computer architecture;computer science education;student engagement,IEEE Conferences,Spain,Science Advances
Qualification and quantification of fuzzy linguistic variables and fuzzy expressions,Y. Wang,2009,"One of the essences of fuzzy logic is how fuzzy variables and fuzzy expressions may be transformed into precise quantities and rigorous models in fuzzy inferences. This paper presents a denotational mathematical structure and methodology for modeling fuzzy qualifications and quantifications in cognitive informatics, soft computing, and computational intelligence. Fuzzy qualifications and quantifications for both absolute and relative measures are formally elaborated on discrete and continuous fuzzy object and expressions. In addition, the qualification for characteristic attributes of fuzzy objects is modeled. Applications of fuzzy qualifications and quantifications are illustrated using a rich set of examples and real-world cases, which enable machines to mimic complex human reasoning mechanisms in cognitive informatics, soft computing, and computational intelligence.",10.1109/COGINF.2009.5250732,IEEE,1.0,IEEE,Cognitive informatics;formal inference;fuzzy inference;fuzzy set;fuzzy logic;fuzzy variables;fuzzy expressions;fuzzy qualification;fuzzy quantification;mathematical models;denotational mathematics;case studies;soft computing;computational intelligence,IEEE Conferences,Spain,Journal of Computer Science
Unified Theory Acceptance and Use of Technology Against Unplugged Computational Thinking Activities,I. S. Ahmad; T. Y. Sim; C. A. Talib,2023,"Occasionally, there may be a low impact on learning engagement between teachers and students due to, for example, poor internet connection or simply because students have lost their focus. One of the methods to improve learning engagement is through a research framework called Unified Theory Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). This paper adopted 17 UTAUT questions to compare with research variables (pre-post surveys and genders). The user acceptance and use of technology or UTAUT consisted of Likert scale (Strongly disagree to Strongly Agree) questions, computed to generate total scores for each participant. Then, the scores will be compared to each variable to investigate the relationships between these variables against the UTAUT. This study could be implemented via online learning, but in the end, the offline (unplugged) method was the only method to deliver the learning activities. There is limited evidence discussing UTAUT within the area of offline learning; hence, this paper will focus on another spectrum regarding the UTAUT study. Instead of mobile (online) learning engagement, this paper studies the relationship between unplugged learning with user acceptance and the use of technology. Spearman correlation indicated that the unplugged learning approach has a significant positive relationship with user acceptance and use of technology. It revealed that students may also demonstrate an interest in online learning engagement and be able to comprehensively accept the online learning approach. In contrast, Mann-Whitney U test analysis on genders revealed no significant difference. The findings could contribute to another noteworthy discussion regarding the validity of user acceptance and the use of technology against the unplugged learning approach.",10.1109/ICOCO59262.2023.10397736,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,UTAUT;computational thinking;unplugged learning,IEEE Conferences,Australia,Computers & Education

An ISMP Approach for Promoting Design Innovation Capability and Its Interaction With Personal Characters,G. Chen; Y. He; T. Yang,2020,"This article develops an instruction method for promoting design innovation capability through a design-based program with identification, modeling, simulation, and prototyping (IMSP). The computational thinking and conceptualization of sustainability were incorporated. The interaction between instruction treatment and participants' personality was investigated. Eighty-six engineering undergraduates participated in this experimental study for exploring the effectiveness of the IMSP program. The findings indicate that 1) the IMSP program promoted undergraduates' computational thinking, and further enhanced their design innovation ability; 2) the program that integrated the conceptualization of sustainability has better teaching effects than that without the conceptual integration; 3) the personal characters of innovation proaction and emotional intelligence acted as moderators in the ISMP program.

Machine Thinking for Telehealth – Toward the Next Generation of Healthcare,A. C. M. Fong; M. Usman,2020,"The revival of artificial intelligence (AI) a few years ago has often been attributed to the success of machine learning (ML), especially the branch of ML known as deep learning (DL). Since the introduction of workable DL, numerous success stories have been widely reported: board games, autonomous driving vehicles, natural language translation, voice recognition, etc. However, for machines to exhibit a high degree of intelligence, they need more than the ability to learn. Indeed, heavy reliance on ML has resulted in widely publicized mishaps that negatively affect people in unexpected ways. For healthcare and other mission-critical applications, intelligent machines need to perform dependably to earn and maintain the trust of human users. To this end, it is necessary to take a holistic view toward AI, one that encompasses multiple facets of what constitutes intelligence. Specifically, this paper previews what thinking machines would be capable of by taking into consideration a machine's ability to abstract and reason, in addition to its ability to learn.",10.1109/SBBS50483.2020.9314935,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,artificial intelligence;knowledge representation;machine intelligence;machine learning;machine thinking;reasoning system;semantic computing;telehealth,IEEE Conferences,Germany,Computers & Education
Measuring Cognitive Loads while Learning Computational Statistics,R. Quintero-Manes; C. Vieira; N. Hernandez-Vargas,2022,"This work-in-progress paper is part of a project that aims to analyze how the implementation of different instructional designs through complete and incomplete examples influence the cognitive load that students perceive when learning statistics and computer programming. For this first stage, we conducted a pilot study aimed at conducting a differentiated measurement of cognitive loads through secondary tasks and a subjective scale. The pilot study consisted of three moments. The first one focused on measuring their working memory capacity and their prior knowledge of statistics. Then, students worked on a learning activity focused on using Chi-square and Pearson correlation to conduct inferential analyses. The study included two different instructional designs in the form of computational notebooks. Design 1 consisted of correct and incomplete examples, while Design 2 included correct, incomplete, and incorrect examples. Simultaneously, students had to attend to a secondary task, which consisted of responding to an auditory stimulus, after which they had to press a key on their keyboard. Finally, students completed a naïve rating scale of cognitive loads involved in the task. The results highlight the important role of prior knowledge in different instructional designs and how it connects to students' perceived cognitive effort. Likewise, the differences in the instructional designs influenced students' cognitive loads, suggesting a differentiated measure of extraneous loads. Using incorrect examples in learning statistics and programming may affect students' perceived difficulty without resulting in a better learning outcome.",10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962606,IEEE,1.0,IEEE,Cognitive load;Computational Statistics;Computational Thinking;Subjective Scale;Secondary Task;Working Memory,IEEE Conferences,Brazil,Journal of Machine Learning Research
DGCC: A Case for Integration of Brain Cognition and Intelligence Computation,G. Wang,2018,"Both human brain and computer (electronic brain) could process data and do some cognition and computation tasks. Is the cognition of human brain equal to the computation of computer? It is obviously not. In this talk, the relationships of brain cognition models and intelligence computation models are summarized into four different types, that is, human brain cognition inspired intelligence computation (BCIIC), intelligence computation without human brain cognition (ICOBC), intelligence computation assisted human brain cognition (ICABC), and the integration of human brain cognition and intelligence computation (BC&IC). There are three paradigms in traditional artificial intelligence (AI) studies, that is, symbolism AI, connectionism AI, and behaviorism AI. The physical symbol system hypothesis is used in the symbolism AI. Human brain cognition is taken as a kind of symbolic processing, and the processes of human thinking are computed by symbol in the symbolism AI [1,2]. The connectionism AI relies on the bionics to simulate human brain. In the connectionism AI, neuron is taken as the basic unite of human thinking, and the intelligence is taken as the result of interconnected neurons competition and collaboration [3,4]. In the behaviorism AI, intelligence depends on the perception and behavior, “Perception-action” model is used, and intelligence may not require knowledge, knowledge representation and knowledge reasoning [5]. The symbolism AI and connectionism AI are two different types of human brain cognition inspired intelligence computation, while the behaviorism AI is a representative case of intelligence computation without human brain cognition. Usually, AI researchers get some inspiration from human brain cognition in their studies. On the other way, intelligence computation could also assist human brain cognition studies. The bidirectional cognitive computing model (BCC) is such a case. It studies the bidirectional transformations between the intension and extension of a concept. It is used to simulate some human brain cognition tasks such as learning and recognition [6,7]. Cognitive computing is one of the core fields of artificial intelligence [8,9]. Data-driven granular cognitive computing (DGCC) is an example of the integration of human brain cognition and intelligence computation [10,11]. It takes data as a special kind of knowledge expressed in the lowest granularity level of a multiple granularity space. It integrates two contradictory mechanisms, namely, the human's cognition mechanism of ``global precedence'' which is a cognition process of ``from coarser to finer'' and the information processing mechanism of machine learning systems which is ``from finer to coarser'', in a multiple granularity space. It is data-driven cognitive computing model. The integration of human brain cognition and intelligence computation would be an important research topic of artificial intelligence. Some scientific research issues of the integration of human brain cognition and intelligence computation are discussed based on DGCC.",10.1109/ICDMW.2018.00076,IEEE,2.0,IEEE,"brain cognition, intelligence computation, artificial intelligence, cognitive computing, granular computing",IEEE Conferences,Australia,Computers & Education
"Perspectives on engineering design learning: Realities, challenges, and recommendations",W. Akili,2015,"Design is considered by most to be the central activity of engineering. Also, it is known that engineering programs should graduate engineers who can design effectively to meet social and environmental needs. Though the role and perception of design across a wide range of educational institutions have improved markedly in recent years; however, both, design faculty & design practitioners argue that further improvements are necessary. One of the defining characteristics of design is that there is rarely a single correct answer to an engineering problem but, rather, an optimal or acceptable solution leading to a final design, presented as the best possible balance between technical as well as non-technical constraints. These nontechnical constraints typically involve economics, politics, social and environmental issues, ethics, etc. And, while professional practitioners generally accept this understanding of design, students, by enlarge, tend to interpret the engineering design process as an unambiguous and clearly defined process supported by rigidly applied principles and processes of “the scientific method.” Students' vision and mis-concepts of design do require proper alignment with prevailing conditions on the ground. Undoubtedly, the start of any design course should be preceded by exposure to design thinking and related processes. The paper reviews the role of design in engineering programs, and outlines the current research on how design thinking processes could be taught and learned. It explores also the currently most-favored pedagogical model for teaching design, namely: Project-Based Learning (PBL). The paper identifies several contexts for PBL, along with some available data on it success. Finally, the paper raises some of the questions that should be answered to identify the most effective pedagogical practices of improving design learning.",10.1109/FIE.2015.7344190,IEEE,3.0,IEEE,Design education;design thinking;convergent & divergent thinking;project-based learning;the hybrid approach;team environment,IEEE Conferences,Germany,Nature Communications
Simulation education is no substitute for intelligent thinking,Paul; Eldabi; Kuljis,2003,"We present a critique of the current teaching practices of simulation. We challenge the current view of simulation, to the extent that most textbooks' contents will be found to be secondary to the missing necessary primary material. We advocate that (simulation) education has four general objectives, which are to teach students how to learn, how to think creatively, how to problem solve, and how to be professionals. These four objectives of education may not be possible to teach. In the words of Oscar Wilde, ""Education is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught"". So an education in simulation requires that students be put into learning situations that enable them to learn the requisite knowledge concerning the four objectives.",10.1109/WSC.2003.1261662,IEEE,3.0,IEEE,,IEEE Conferences,Argentina,Science Advances
Nature Management Models as a Tool for Forming Optimisation Thinking of Students,S. Chernyshenko,2021,"In the frames of the process of informatisation of education, the issue of the formation of optimization thinking among high school students has been considered. The formation of this kind of competences cannot be ensured by purely theoretical training; therefore, it is proposed to use models of optimal environmental management as vivid examples of solving optimization problems. The models illustrate such basic optimization concepts as the objective functional, different kinds of constraints, and the formulation of nonlinear and dynamic programming problems. Using the examples of managing the process of forest restoration, the importance of the correct selection of parameters of the model and methods for solving the optimization problem is shown. Concrete examples of using the proposed technique are given.",10.1109/TELE52840.2021.9482561,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,optimisation problems;didactics of higher education;optimal control;nature management;forest restoration;mathematical modelling,IEEE Conferences,Australia,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
Analyzing the Learning Process in Online Educational Game Design: A Case Study,N. Ahmadi; M. Jazayeri,2014,"Educational game design environments are used for teaching computational thinking and software engineering concepts to novices. In software engineering education, there has recently been calls for ""innovative methods for software teaching and training in online courses"" (http://2014.icse-conferences.org/seet). However, to date, learning these concepts is tied to a formal learning environment and the presence of a teacher. In line with the new educational opportunities provided by the Web such as massive open online courses (MOOCs) and e-learning 2.0 platforms, we have created an online educational game design environment with integrated learning resources including video tutorials, showcases, and communication tools. To understand the effect of online educational game design environments with integrated support for learning on novices' use of the system and their learning, we conducted a mixed-method study with nine participants. While the learning goals were achieved to a high degree, the analysis of participants' interaction with the system reveals interesting phenomena about user preferences, such as the fact that during the given computational thinking tasks, the participants preferred the synchronous communication channel to other forms of commonly provided learning resources such as forums.",10.1109/ASWEC.2014.34,IEEE,3.0,IEEE,computer science education;computational thinking;educational game design;end-user programming;cyberlearning;MOOC;learning analytics,IEEE Conferences,Chile,ACM Transactions on Graphics
Technologies That Make You Smile: Adding Humor to Text-Based Applications,R. Mihalcea; C. Strapparava,2006,"Natural language's creative genres are traditionally considered to be outside the scope of computational modeling. Computational linguists have paid little attention to humor in particular because it is puzzling by nature. However, given the importance of humor in our daily lives and computers in our work and entertainment, studies related to computational humor will become increasingly significant in fields such as human-computer interaction, intelligent interactive entertainment, and computer-assisted education. In this article, we explore computational approaches' applicability to the recognition and use of verbally expressed humor. Particularly, we focus on three important research questions related to this problem: Can we automatically gather large collections of humorous texts? Can we automatically recognize humor in text?

This activity, referred to as #CreaCube, is presented as an open-ended problem which consists of assembling a set of robotic cubes into an autonomous vehicle. We not only anchor our formalization in classical learning science frameworks but we also propose to draw on neuro-cognitive models to describe the observed behaviors of learners engaged in this activity. The chosen formalism is symbolic and is aligned on upper ontologies to ensure that the vocabulary is well specified. This allows for a better communication between the summoned research fields, namely, learning science, cognitive neuroscience, and computational modeling.

Computational thinking and impacts on K-12 science education,R. J. Toedte; M. Aydeniz,2015,"Jeannette Wing's seminal computational thinking (CT) paper, published in 2006, set forth CT as not just a way of looking at computational problems, but as an alternative approach to solving everyday problems. We strongly support Wing's assertion. Accordingly, we report the results of our meta-analysis of CT curricular implementations since 2006. Our principle interest is in CT framings and implementations for K-12 audiences in disciplines other than computer science, thus fulfilling the broad appeal and utility originally prescribed by Wing. We break CT down into its constituent characteristics, and split these characteristics into two principle groups: mechanistic (inextricably tied to and limited by computer science) and humanistic (separable from and adaptable beyond computer science). We use this conceptual bifurcation as a basis for selecting and analyzing implementations of CT for subsequent reporting. We summarize our CT meta-analytical results by distributional themes including grades, disciplinary foci, equity groups, and programming paradigms. In conclusion, we make recommendations for improving K-12 CT curricular implementations. Our hope is that utilization of CT characteristics and principles will become more commonplace in public education, be utilized more continuously through primary and secondary grades, and be inventively applied across a more inclusive range of academic disciplines.",10.1109/FIE.2015.7344239,IEEE,3.0,IEEE,education;pedagogy;computational thinking;K-12;science education;computer science,IEEE Conferences,UK,Science Advances

STEM-Based Bayesian Computational Learning Model-BCLM for Effective Learning of Bayesian Statistics,I. E. Khuda; S. Ahmad; A. Ashraf Ateya,2024,"This work contributes to the comprehension of Bayes’ theorem inclusive Bayesian probabilities and Bayesian inferencing within the framework of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) and cognitive learning w.r.t Bloom’s taxonomy (BT). Bayes’ theorem is taken as a crucial statistical instrument employed in the development of intelligent systems and the management of risks, commonly utilized by engineers for tasks in machine learning and managerial decision-making. The fundamental concept behind Bayes’ theorem revolves around comprehending the degree of truth within the confines of an explicit perspective. This involves partitioning the entire sample space of possible evidence and utilizing the subset containing the relevant perspective to estimate the uncertainty of an event or the reliability of a model. However, it is often found difficult for students to understand Bayes’ theorem to the level of applying it to real-world problems. Considering this, the proposed learning method in this paper elucidated the acquisition of Bayes’ mathematical formulation by leveraging computational thinking, leading to the development of a computational model. The proposed model is named the Bayesian Computational Learning Model (BCLM). Subsequently, we have probed the utility of BCLM in the design and plan of learning activities, coherent to the STEM paradigm and BT cognitive learning hierarchy.",10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3420731,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Bloom’s taxonomy;Bayes’ theorem;computational thinking;computer simulations;decision making;engineering education;frequentist;intelligent systems design;machine learning;project management;risk analysis;STEM,IEEE Journals,Canada,Nature Communications

My Robot can tell stories: Introducing robotics and physical computing to children using dynamic dioaramas,G. Manikutty,2021,"From time immemorial, stories have caught the fascination of young and old. Rural children in India, in particular, have a natural way of telling stories that are rooted in their heritage of social norms, values, and belief systems that are compelling and emotionally engaging. The process of writing and narrating their own stories enhances their verbal proficiency and makes them reflect deeply upon the story theme, thereby enabling them to develop higher-order thinking. In this research study, the author used stories to introduce physical computing and robotics to children in rural India in a personally meaningful manner. Children created interactive cultural dioramas based on classical stories from Indian folklore with robotic puppets that they programmed using the Scratch programming language. They learned 21st-century skills of creativity, communication, collaboration, and critical thinking by working in groups wherein they learned to divide tasks, manage time, work together, debate the pros and cons of different ideas, listen, think out of the box, and be active and engaged. The author observed that such an intervention improved the children's sense of agency and their interest in robotics and computational thinking. The author presents her results from pilot studies conducted in 2019 from two semi-urban schools in India on the children's perception of creating robots, programming, tinkering with electronics, career in robotics, and the workshop experience itself - all of which suggests that the children were deeply engaged and enthusiastic throughout the workshop making the entire learning experience a meaningful and joyful one for all. The results indicate that such culturally sensitive interventions can help children from collectivistic cultures embrace technology while preserving their traditional identities and cultural cohesion.",10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637460,IEEE,5.0,IEEE,STEM;Physical Computing;Robotics Education;21st Century Skills;Middle School Education;K-12 education,IEEE Conferences,UK,Science Advances

Data Mining Framework to Analyze the Evolution of Computational Thinking Skills in Game Building Workshops,A. A. de Souza; T. S. Barcelos; R. Munoz; R. Villarroel; L. A. Silva,2019,"Computational thinking has become a required capability in the student learning process, and digital games as a teaching approach have presented promising educational results in the development of this competence. However, properly evaluating the effectiveness and, consequently, student progress in a course using games is still a challenge. One of the most widely implemented ways of evaluation is with an automated analysis of the code developed in the classes during the construction of digital games. Nevertheless, this topic has not yet been explored in aspects such as incremental learning, the model and teaching environment and the influences of acquiring skills and competencies of computational thinking. Motivated by this knowledge gap, this paper introduces a framework proposal to analyze the evolution of computational thinking skills in digital games classes. The framework is based on a data mining technique that aims to facilitate the discovery process of the patterns and behaviors that lead to the acquisition of computational thinking skills, by analyzing clusters with an unsupervised neural network of self-organizing maps (SOM) for this purpose. The framework is composed of a collection of processes and practices structured in data collection, data preprocessing, data analysis, and data visualization. A case study, using Scratch, was executed to validate this approach. The results point to the viability of the framework, highlighting the use of the visual exploratory data analysis, through the SOM maps, as an efficient tool to observe the acquisition of computational thinking skills by the student in an incremental course.",10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2924343,IEEE,20.0,IEEE,Analytical models;computer science education;data mining;data models;education;games;self-organizing feature maps,IEEE Journals,Italy,Nature Communications

In this paper, CT is represented through the graphical programming language Scratch according to the three-dimensional CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick [1]. This project aims to explore the classroom effect of using graphical programming tool in learning English dialogue and investigate how to improve the integration of CT into English education with the elements of programming. To achieve these objectives, a qualitative method was adopted to collect data through class observations, programming projects, and semi-structured interviews. Nine primary students (n = 9) were the targeted participants, who attended extra-curricular lessons for computer programming using Scratch at their school in Hong Kong. The preliminary results show that the introduction of CT into English dialogue learning through graphical programming language can motivate primary school students to study English dialogue. To better connect CT with English education via graphical programming tools, students and the teacher in the group under study suggested making computers interact with people autonomically, designing games in graphical programming environments to encourage English learning, keeping the balance of students' graphical programming language learning skill and their English language skill, and adopting graphical programming language as a tool to finish the summative English language assignments.",10.1109/TALE.2017.8252356,IEEE,8.0,IEEE,Computational Thinking;English dialogue learning;Graphical programming language;Classroom effect,IEEE Conferences,Japan,Computers & Education

Cybersecurity is of similar importance; however, it can be difficult for young learners to grasp the required concepts and use them to construct meaningful algorithms. We discuss our approach that combines a hands-on robotics platform with a block-based programming environment to facilitate the learning and application of cybersecurity and CT concepts. Throughout a week-long intervention, high school students were introduced to cybersecurity and CT and given the opportunity to apply this knowledge in a collaborative setting to solve security problems on the robotics platform with instructor and peer support. A series of competitions between groups of students further motivated students to translate their learned concepts to practice, often leading to breakthroughs as students incorporated new algorithms into their existing projects to counteract previous security flaws. We present evidence of the learning behaviors of several such groups through mixed-method case studies integrating data collected from learning performance, collaborative discourse, and analysis of program development.

To design such a program it is necessary to have a deep knowledge about the meaning of CT and its targets. Although CT skills are of paramount importance to all (since they bring numerous advantages for problem solving activities), in our context we see them as a pre-requisite for the learning of Computer Programming (CP). In order to design a CT training program supported by a rigorous framework, we decided to build an ontology that goes deeper into the underlying concepts and relates both domains, CT and CP. The outcome, OntoCnE (that stands for Ontologia para Computação na Escola in Portuguese), made clear what shall be trained in terms of reasoning to understand programming and being able to use it to solve problems using the computer. Moreover, OntoCnE also provides a clear insight on the concepts to be taught in each scholar year, as well as, on the instruments (hereafter called Learning Resources, LR) to be used in each moment for each specific purpose. This paper aims to introduce OntoCnE and demonstrates how to use it to classify LRs aiming to build a repository from where they can be picked up in a clear way.

Neuroeducation: Guidelines for Computational Thinking training,C. Araújo; P. R. Henriques; J. J. Cerqueira,2023,"Computational Thinking (CT) skills are a key competency for all citizens, but for Computer Programming students these abilities are crucial. Several studies claim that students have deficits in many of the CT skills and therefore it is important to develop and improve these skills. For that purpose, Teachers responsible for the children’s education have to plan as soon as possible effective ways for training CT skills. There are already many Learning Resources (LR) for this training, however, we believe that Neuroeducation can contribute to improving the impact of these LR in the teaching and learning process. Currently, Educational Neuroscience presents a solid set of scientific evidence on how the brain learns more effectively. This important knowledge about the brain’s learning process can be turned into principles applicable in Education. This paper starts emphasising those principles that can benefit the teaching and learning process. Based on this scientific evidence, we propose the adoption of a set of guidelines that can contribute to innovative CT training. Neuroeducation applies the latest theoretical advances in the human brain and psychology to pedagogy. The guidelines inspired by Neuroeducation that we propose here aim to provide instructions for the teacher to apply in their pedagogical practices and in LR, in order to promote more effective training. One concrete LR for primary school, created by our Master’s Students in Computing Education, will be used, as a case study, to illustrate our proposal.",10.1109/SIIE59826.2023.10423685,IEEE,1.0,IEEE,Computational Thinking;Neuroeducation;Pedagogy;Learning Resources,IEEE Conferences,China,Journal of Machine Learning Research
Examining Teacher Perspectives on Computational Thinking in K-12 Classrooms,Q. Burke; J. Roschelle; C. Bailey; C. Angevine; J. Weisgrau; K. Mills,2020,"This paper examines K-12 teacher perspectives on the promise and challenges of computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) education for all students across three states and three school districts-one rural, one suburban, and one urban. Through a series of teacher survey and focus groups, this exploratory research presents the perspectives of K-12 teachers across three distinct vantage points: First, to what degree do these teachers see a clear value as to why CS and CT matter to their students' learning? Second (if the pathway is deemed valuable) who, in their estimates, are the crucial players to help develop a coherent CS/ CT K-12 pathway and what is their capacity? Third, how can such a prospective pathway be practically implemented? These elements of why, who, and how are essential to wider questions around equity of student access to high quality computing, and with this paper, they come from the perspectives of teachers-a group too often left out of early discussions around K-12 curricular design. Discussion section points to how these preliminary surveys and focus groups with teachers offer an early predictor in terms of how each district develops its own K-12 computing pathway, with the expectation that such focus groups offer a powerful research/ evaluation protocol that can be repeated annually among districts to gauge to what extent teachers' hope (and concerns) about comprehensive K-12 computing pathways are warranted.",10.1109/RESPECT49803.2020.9272483,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,computational thinking;competency-based education;educational infrastructure,IEEE Conferences,China,Journal of Computer Science
A Method for Assigning Weight to the Assessment Indicators of Computational Thinking with XGBoost,X. Zeng; W. Zhang; Y. Chen; H. Chen,2023,"Computational thinking (CT) assessment indicator assignment is an important strategy for optimizing assessment and an effective method for exploring differences in the importance of assessment indicators. However, the objectivity of the previous methods for assigning assessment indicators of CT is insufficient. Therefore, the paper proposed to use the XGBoost machine learning model to fit the assessment data, fully explore the data features and realize the weighting of CT assessment indicators. The CT assessment indicators are used as the features of XGBoost model training and the assessment levels are used as the training labels to obtain the feature weights through XGBoost model training. The feature weights are used as the CT assessment indicator weights to realize the weighting of assessment indicators of CT in reverse. From the analysis of the CT assessment indicator assignment results, the analysis of the importance of the assessment indicators and the comparative analysis of the assessment results before and after the indicator assignment, it is found that the CT assessment after the indicator assignment has higher robustness and credibility.",10.1109/WAIE60568.2023.00024,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Computational thinking;XGBoost;Assessment indicators;Indicator weight,IEEE Conferences,Italy,Journal of Computer Science

Granell,2024,"This article discusses the latest developments of the Sucre4Stem tool, as part of the Sucre initiative, which aims to promote interest in computational thinking and programming skills in K-12 students. The tool follows the Internet of Things approach and consists of two prominent components: 1) SucreCore and 2) SucreCode. SucreCore incorporates an advanced microcontroller packaged in a more compact design and enables wireless connectivity. SucreCode, the block-based visual programming tool, supports two different sets of blocks depending on the education grade, and facilitates wireless communication with SucreCore. At the educational level, Sucre4Stem fosters new group dynamics and encourages students to experiment real-world projects by promoting the “programming to learn” approach to concepts from other disciplines as opposed to the strategy widely applied in schools of “learning to program” in isolation.",10.1109/TE.2024.3422666,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Computational thinking;Internet of Things (IoT);K-12;multidisciplinary disciplines;programming promotion,IEEE Early Access Articles,UK,Journal of Machine Learning Research
Introducing Computational Thinking in Middle-Schools using a Culturally-responsive Game through a Researcher-Practitioner Partnership,I. Villanueva-Miranda; K. Mortimer; M. Akbar; R. R. Reyes; C. Ontiveros; S. Gray; P. Delgado; V. Medrano; M. Anderson; J. Ramirez; J. Vazquez,2023,"There is a national need to increase the number of minority students entering STEM fields with essential computing skills. To increase minority students’ interest and engagement in computing, a researcher-practitioner partnership between the University of Texas at El Paso and the El Paso Independent School District, developed and implemented a culturally and linguistically responsive curriculum and pedagogy to introduce computational thinking (CT) in two middle schools across different subject areas in a borderland region. The curriculum leveraged the Sol y Agua game – a bilingual, culturally-responsive game designed to engage students of this region in CT. This paper describes the process and initial findings of this project. The quantitative data from in-game analyses show that students utilized the language change feature to switch from English to Spanish more frequently than the other way – highlighting the need for educational platforms relatable to students through language, environment, and cultural context. Analyses of the qualitative data indicate that while teachers/team members understood CT and translanguaging concepts and taught lesson units that provided opportunities to practice both, CT and translanguaging were largely implicit in the curriculum. In collaborative analyses of these patterns, teachers described additional supports that would help them to make CT instruction and translanguaging strategies more explicit in the content and pedagogy, highlighting the need for systematic, targeted integration of these concepts.",10.1109/BigData59044.2023.10386409,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Computational thinking;K-12 education;Computer games,IEEE Conferences,Spain,Computers & Education
A Systematic Approach to Catalogue Learning Resources that Promote Computational Thinking,C. Araújo; P. Rangel Henriques; J. José Cerqueira,2024,"Computational Thinking (CT) is a transversal ability to solve problems in any area, is crucial for Computer Programming. We believe that CT skills should be developed and encouraged from a young age. However, to promote the development of CT it is necessary to use appropriate materials, which we call Learning Resources (LR). For a more efficient development of CT, it is important that the LR are designed and used in order to obtain the maximum potential of the resource. Scientific evidence from Neuroeducation can be used to fully explore LR. There are many LR available to promote CT, however, they are not correctly classified in order to be easy to understand what specific CT skills they stimulate, neither which ages they are adequate for. Directions for their most convenient usage are also lacking. This paper aims to present an approach to categorize these LR so that when a teacher intends to promote the development of one or more specific CT skills, in a given schooling year, he can find the adequate LR more easily, and also get educational resources concerning their use. This characterization approach is based on OntoCnE ontology. OntoCnE was built by us and is composed of 4 layers that define: how to develop CT (1); which concepts should be taught at each school level (2); which materials are appropriate for each skill (3); and the Neuroeducation guidelines associated with each resource (4). This paper essentially focuses on layers 3 and 4 to perform the LR characterization. To illustrate our approach, we will follow OntoCnE statements to categorize a set of LRs. With this methodological setting we intend to build a catalog of LR more effectively promote CT skills on children.",10.1109/SIIE63180.2024.10604485,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Computational Thinking;Ontology;OntoCnE;Learning Resources;Neuroeducation,IEEE Conferences,Brazil,Computers & Education
Constructing a Computational Thinking Evaluation Framework for Pupils,Y. -S. Su; X. Wang; L. Zhao,2024,"Research Purpose and Contribution: The study aimed to construct an evaluation framework for assessing pupils’ computational thinking (CT) during classroom learning problem solving. As a self-report evaluation scale for pupils, this evaluation framework further enriched the CT assessment instruments for pupils and provided a specialized instrument for experts to evaluate pupils’ CT in problem-solving situations during classroom learning.  Background: CT cultivation and assessment methods are hot topics in the field of education. CT assessment can effectively test the effect of CT cultivation. There are many CT assessment methods, of which evaluation frameworks are an effective self-reporting assessment method. Existing studies on self-reported CT evaluation frameworks are commonly applicable to students at different stages. However, few studies have focused on the specific context from the perspective of practice for pupils. Thus, the evaluation framework of pupils’ CT is worth exploring.  Intended Outcomes: A CT evaluation framework for evaluating pupils’ CT in problem-solving situations in classroom learning was constructed to facilitate researchers’ understanding of pupils’ CT levels and problem-solving skills.  Application Design: In this study, data from 897 pupils in the fifth and sixth grades were collected using an online questionnaire that included 27 items about CT. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and item analysis were conducted to analyze the data in this study, with 17 items remaining in the final evaluation framework.  Findings: The fitting validity, convergence validity, and discriminant validity all met the recommended criteria, which showed that the evaluation framework was effective. The total reliability of CT was 0.911, indicating that the consistency and reliability of the evaluation framework constructed in this study were satisfied.",10.1109/TE.2024.3424423,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Classroom learning;computational thinking (CT);evaluation framework;pupils,IEEE Early Access Articles,Germany,Journal of Computer Science
A Survey on Story Generation Techniques for Authoring Computational Narratives,B. Kybartas; R. Bidarra,2017,"Computers are often used as tools to design, implement, and even visualize a variety of narrative forms. Many researchers and artists are now further attempting to engage the computer actively throughout the development of the narrative itself. Any form of computational narrative authoring is at some level always mixed-initiative , meaning that the processing capabilities of the computer are utilized with a varying degree to automate certain features of the authoring process. We structure this survey by focusing on two key components of stories, plot and space, and more specifically the degree to which these are either automated by the computer or authored manually. By examining the successes of existing research, we identify potential new research directions in the field of computational narrative. We also identify the advantages of developing a standard model of narrative to allow for collaboration between plot and space automation techniques. This would likely benefit the field of automated space generation with the strengths in the field of automated plot generation.",10.1109/TCIAIG.2016.2546063,IEEE,69.0,IEEE,Automated storytelling;computational narrative authoring;procedural content generation;story generation,IEEE Journals,UK,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
Computational Modeling of Prefrontal Cortex for Meta-Cognition of a Humanoid Robot,E. Daglarli,2020,"For robot intelligence and human-robot interaction (HRI), complex decision-making, interpretation, and adaptive planning processes are great challenges. These require recursive task processing and meta-cognitive reasoning mechanism. Naturally, the human brain realizes these cognitive skills by prefrontal cortex which is a part of the neocortex. Previous studies about neurocognitive robotics would not meet these requirements. Thus, it is aimed at developing a brain-inspired robot control architecture that performs spatial-temporal and emotional reasoning. In this study, we present a novel solution that covers a computational model of the prefrontal cortex for humanoid robots. Computational mechanisms are mainly placed on the bio-physical plausible neural structures embodied in different dynamics. The main components of the system are composed of several computational modules including dorsolateral, ventrolateral, anterior, and medial prefrontal regions. Also, it is responsible for organizing the working memory. A reinforcement meta-learning based explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) procedure is applied to the working memory regions of the computational prefrontal cortex model. Experimental evaluation and verification tests are processed by the developed software framework embodied in the humanoid robot platform. The humanoid robots' perceptual states and cognitive processes including emotion, attention, and intention-based reasoning skills can be observed and controlled via the developed software. Several interaction scenarios are implemented to monitor and evaluate the model's performance.",10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2998396,IEEE,8.0,IEEE,Artificial intelligence;brain modeling;cognitive robotics;human-robot interaction,IEEE Journals,Mexico,Nature Communications

Educational Robotics Applied to Computational Thinking Development: A Systematic Mapping Study,I. M. L. Souza; W. L. Andrade; L. M. R. Sampaio,2021,"Educational Robotics (ER) is a tool that can favor teamwork, stimulate creativity, and the ability to solve students' problems through the process of assembling and programming robots. In this sense, ER has been used to improve educational practices. There are several initiatives that seek to stimulate Computational Thinking (CT) to stand out. Although ER being used to develop CT, there are still no guidelines based on scientific studies that support this use. The objective of this Research Full Paper is to identify: a) the main pedagogical approaches are applied in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; b) the central difficulties are encountered in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; c) the CT skills are presents in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; d) the instruments are used to assess students' CT during classes with ER; e) the students' profile who participated in classes with ER focused o on developing students' CT; f) the educational robotics technologies are adopted in classes focused on developing students' CT. To achieve these goals, we planned and carried out systematic mapping of the literature. The results show that, through ER, CT is approached through the teaching of programming languages in a collaborative way in Early Childhood and High School. The most CT skills observed are related to programming, such as sequencing, algorithm, loop, generalization, decomposition, and debugging. The main instruments for assessing students are tests, and the most significant difficulty is the limitation of class hours.

Adapting Computational Skills for AI Integration,H. Elhashemy; H. Abelson; T. Michaeli,2024,"In today's data-driven world, the importance of data literacy is paramount. However, software engineering education has not adequately addressed integrating comprehensive data science curricula, leaving students ill-equipped for the future of artificial intelligence (AI), which is built on the foundations of data science. This gap is exacerbated by the lack of tailored courses and the intimidating nature of existing tools for begin-ners. Consequently, students often miss out on essential skills like data cleanup, real-world application of machine learning (ML) algorithms, and the integration of big data in software products. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel approach to applied data science for software engineering students. We argue for a shift from traditional algorithm-focused teaching to a curriculum emphasizing real-world problem-solving, lever-aging data science techniques. By empowering students to define and tackle their own data-driven projects, we aim to increase motivation, enhance data literacy, and instill a data-thinking mindset in future software engineers to prepare them for the AI world.

Analyzing Students’ Computational Thinking Practices in a First-Year Engineering Course,L. M. Cruz Castro; A. J. Magana; K. A. Douglas; M. Boutin,2021,"This study investigates the relationship between two related computational thinking practices: data practices and computational problem-solving practices in acquiring related computational thinking practices during a first-year undergraduate engineering course. While computational thinking theory is still developing, empirical studies can help further understand how students demonstrate this knowledge and their progression in attaining the practices. Therefore, with this empirical study, the following questions are addressed. RQ1: What are the differences in students' computational thinking practices at the beginning of an undergraduate introductory programming course? RQ 2: How do these differences correspond to the acquisition of more advanced computational thinking practices? The use of a descriptive non-experimental design that aims to understand the correlation between practices related to data and computational problem-solving is presented. A machine learning technique is employed, utilizing historical data from introductory programming for a problem-solving course with more than 1000 first-year engineering students. After identifying groups of students defining different profiles, data from posterior performance in more advanced programming topics were descriptively analyzed. This study supports the characterization of four different student profiles demonstrating differences in their performance at the beginning of the semester. From these four profiles, two of them show a subsequent differential progression besides their similarity at the beginning of the semester. In this particular case, troubleshooting and debugging appear as a relevant competency when distinguishing these two learners' groups. These findings suggest that previous knowledge or exposure to different practices can result in different progressions of more complex computational practices, emphasizing the relevance of troubleshooting and debugging as a practice required for a successful and timely progression on the acquisition of other computational thinking practices.",10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3061277,IEEE,11.0,IEEE,Engineering education;engineering students;pattern analysis;statistical learning,IEEE Journals,France,PLOS ONE
Computational Intelligence for Modeling and Optimization of RFEH and WPT Systems: A Comprehensive Survey,D. Sarkar; T. Khan; F. A. Talukdar; S. R. Rengarajan,2023,"Several practical engineering optimization problems are computationally demanding, requiring a large amount of computer time, processing power, and memory. These challenges can be mitigated by human-engineered systems exhibiting intelligent behavior. With the evolution of high-speed digital computers, the use of computational intelligence (CI) techniques has increased rapidly. According to Bezdek [1], “A system is called computationally intelligent if it deals with low-level data such as numerical data, has a pattern-recognition component and does not use knowledge in the artificial intelligence (AI) sense, and additionally when it begins to exhibit computational adaptivity, fault tolerance, speed approaching human-like turnaround and error rates that approximate human performance.” Another definition, by Engelbrecht [2], states that “CI is the study of adaptive mechanisms that enable or facilitate intelligent behavior in complex and changing environments. These mechanisms include those Artificial Intelligence paradigms that exhibit an ability to learn or adapt to new situations, to generalize, abstract, discover and associate.” Thus, CI is the general term used to classify all such nature-inspired methodologies and their associated theories and applications. The five important paradigms of the CI technique are artificial neural networks (ANNs), swarm intelligence (SI), evolutionary computation (EC), and fuzzy systems (FSs). The origin of each technique can be connected to a natural system; for example, an ANN imitates the biological neural system. SI models the behavior of organisms living in swarms, whereas EC models the natural evolution system. Similarly, an FS originates from human thinking processes. Many of the problems involved in designing next-generation systems can be resolved using these CI techniques or their combinations.",10.1109/MMM.2023.3284764,IEEE,1.0,IEEE,,IEEE Magazines,China,Journal of Machine Learning Research

Computational Thinking Curriculum for Unmanned Aerial Systems,S. Zhang; C. Stewart,2019,"Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) can explore common, vast and unsafe places at low cost. They could transform multiple sectors from photography to farming to city planning. However, the software underlying UAS is complex and requires multiple distinct programming skills, e.g., AI, machine learning and flight control. Few programmers encompass these skills, hampering software development and dampening the impact of UAS. We contend that early exposure to UAS software could help align workforce skills. However, early exposure requires curriculum that (1) captures the breadth of UAS software, (2) supports multiple levels of depth for diverse programming backgrounds and (3) fits within resource and institutional challenges. We propose a computational thinking framework. In our approach, lessons fit within 20-30 minute instructional blocks, making them usable in short workshop and extended classroom settings. UAV topics and computational thinking depth link lessons. Teachers can trade breadth for in-depth coding and vice versa. In early work, we presented an autonomous UAS to middle school students.

Online Professional Development for High School Computer Science Teachers: Features That Support an Equity-Based Professional Learning Community,J. Goode; K. Peterson; J. Malyn-Smith; G. Chapman,2020,"A grand challenge of the computer science (CS) for all education movement is the preparation of thousands of teachers with high quality, accessible professional development (PD) that has evidence of improving teacher knowledge and pedagogical practices necessary to support the learning needs of diverse groups of students. While regional PD programs can provide in-person learning opportunities, geographic and time constraints often inhibit participation. This article shares findings from an online PD program modified from the existing in-person exploring computer science PD program to provide teachers a facilitated online learning community model to support their first year teaching the course. The findings from this study have implications for future directions in the CS education field, indicating that this model of online PD, heavily based on shared experience among participants, can increase CS teachers’ confidence in adapting and delivering lessons designed to be engaging and accessible to all students.",10.1109/MCSE.2020.2989622,IEEE,15.0,IEEE,,IEEE Magazines,USA,Science Advances
On bounded rationality in cyber-physical systems security: Game-theoretic analysis with application to smart grid protection,A. Sanjab; W. Saad,2016,"In this paper, a general model for cyber-physical systems (CPSs), that captures the diffusion of attacks from the cyber layer to the physical system, is studied. In particular, a game-theoretic approach is proposed to analyze the interactions between one defender and one attacker over a CPS. In this game, the attacker launches cyber attacks on a number of cyber components of the CPS to maximize the potential harm to the physical system while the system operator chooses to defend a number of cyber nodes to thwart the attacks and minimize potential damage to the physical side. The proposed game explicitly accounts for the fact that both attacker and defender can have different computational capabilities and disparate levels of knowledge of the system. To capture such bounded rationality of attacker and defender, a novel approach inspired from the behavioral framework of cognitive hierarchy theory is developed. In this framework, the defender is assumed to be faced with an attacker that can have different possible thinking levels reflecting its knowledge of the system and computational capabilities. To solve the game, the optimal strategies of each attacker type are characterized and the optimal response of the defender facing these different types is computed. This general approach is applied to smart grid security considering wide area protection with energy markets implications. Numerical results show that a deviation from the Nash equilibrium strategy is beneficial when the bounded rationality of the attacker is considered. Moreover, the results show that the defender's incentive to deviate from the Nash equilibrium decreases when faced with an attacker that has high computational ability.",10.1109/CPSRSG.2016.7684101,IEEE,31.0,IEEE,,IEEE Conferences,USA,Science Advances
Math Word Problem Solving with Dual Solving Thinking Structure,H. Wang,2024,"Math Word Problem, abbreviated as MWP, constitute a class of elementary mathematical application scenarios, commonly encountered within primary secondary educational curricula. Such problems are characterized by their presentation in natural language, eschewing the utilization of intricate mathematical symbols or formulas. The focal task of model geared towards addressing Math Word Problem is twofold: first, to discern and interpret the mathematical concepts encapsulated within the textual descriptions provided, and second, to formulate an appropriate mathematical expression or equation reflective of the problem's essence. Subsequently, these models proceed to compute the solution corresponding to the derived expression, thereby completing the problem-solving process. Currently, advancements in this domain primarily revolve around improvements to encoders and decoders within models, with a relatively narrow scope of thinking processes during model solving. Consequently, the efficacy of expression solving for complex semantic Math Word Problem remains to be enhanced. In contrast to the prevalent sequence-to-tree approach, humans often employ a top-down thinking process to solve Math Word Problem. We introduce a Math Word Problem solving model featuring a dual-thinking structure, comprising a top-down solver, a step-by-step anthropomorphic thinking solver, and a consistent comparison learning module. By aligning expressions derived from two distinct solvers at multiple granularities to maintain consistency, we aim to enhance reasoning correctness. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing baselines, particularly in achieving notable improvements in solving accuracy for complex problems.",10.1109/AINIT61980.2024.10581632,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Math Word Problem;artificial intelligence;top-down solver;step-by-step anthropomorphic thinking solver;dual solving thinking structure,IEEE Conferences,Spain,Journal of Computer Science

Research on the Construction of Evaluation Indicators of Students' Computational Thinking Based on Spectral Clustering,W. Zhang; X. Zeng; D. Ming; J. Wang,2022,"The scientific and reasonable evaluation indicators that can fully reflect the various dimensions of students' computational thinking (CT) skills is the basis and premise of accurately evaluating students' CT skills, which is of great significance to the cultivation of students' CT skills. However, the current research on how to construct the evaluation indicators is still inadequate, and most of the research is put forward by the subjective experience of researchers, lacking objectivity and the universality of ability. In the paper, we comprehensively reviewed the concepts of CT in the theoretical literature of CT, aiming to construct the comprehensive and effective evaluation indicators of CT for students by clustering the keywords of CT concepts and extracting indicators. The validity of indicators is verified by qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis and expert evaluation. The results show that the evaluation indicators of CT constructed by spectral clustering technology are a more scientific, more comprehensive reflection of the ability dimensions of CT.

An Optimized Q-Learning Algorithm Based on the Thinking of Tabu Search,X. Zhang; Z. Liu,2008,"One core issue in reinforcement learning is the balance between exploration and exploitation. Pure exploitation makes the agent reach the partial optimal solution quickly. Exploration avoids the partial optimal solution but too much exploration will reduce the performance of the Q -learning algorithm. How to avoid the partial optimal solution and find the global optimum solution is one of key goals of action selection in Q-learning. In this paper, the thinking of tabu search algorithm is introduced in order to balance exploration and exploitation of Q-learning.

Interdisciplinary education in vocational education and training: Supporting joint up thinking — Some insites in lecturing,M. Grasser; F. Mayer,2015,"The word “competence” is often used in association with education. It is thought that exercises with direct application of theoretical knowledge help students not only to deepen theoretical knowledge but also to awaken curiosity and to make the pupils go for learning. As competences imply the capability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical applications, interdisciplinary education opens big opportunities not only to deepen the knowledge but also to ensure competent application of knowledge. Therefore, lecture projects have been performed in order to broaden and deepen interdisciplinary aspects in a vocational education and training college during the last five years. The topics involved have been computer-aided engineering, measuring and handcraft as well as different theoretical lectures in engineering. The outcome of the presented study is on the one hand a comparison of individual feedback of the involved students to the teacher with results of university research and on the other hand a discussion about observations based on a SWOT analysis, which summarizes the most important statements according to the performed lectures.",10.1109/ICL.2015.7318098,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,competences;vocational education and training;joint up thinking,IEEE Conferences,Spain,ACM Transactions on Graphics

It is found that although most of designers prefer episodic precedents than semantic ones, the two kinds of precedents can help designers in different design phases. When creating initial ideas, episodic precedents help designers to generate more design concepts; when refining ideas, semantic precedents help to make ideas more complete and reasonable. Based on the above discovery, it is suggested that to produce design plans more efficiently, designers refer to suitable precedents in the different design phases.",10.1109/ISCID51228.2020.00058,IEEE,1.0,IEEE,episodic precedents;semantic precedents;design thinking;linkography,IEEE Conferences,Mexico,PLOS ONE

New content behind the concept intelligent engineering,L. Horváth; I. J. Rudas; G. Hancke,2010,"Intelligence in engineering systems is expected to gain much more attention during the next years than presently because making interdependent decisions along contextual chains by an engineer increasingly requires reproduction of earlier decisions by other engineers. While a single decision on an object parameter or parameter group in a product structure may be influenced by several humans, humans are strictly responsible for their decisions. The only way is development of transparent intelligent engineering procedures those are capable for representation of humans. The above features of engineering tasks do not allow application of closed procedures from the conventional knowledge engineering and computational intelligence. The authors are engaged in application of knowledge based methods in intelligent engineering. This paper starts with purposeful characterizing of intelligent engineering features in current industrial product modeling systems. Following this, it discusses possibilities for adding intelligence to current product modeling processes. An earlier proposed method by the authors in modeling of human intent driven engineering objectives and contextual connections as entities to assist decisions is applied. Finally, the authors propose a possible way to capture human thinking process element in order to establish intelligent content in product models.

Helping Engineering Students Learn in Introductory Computer Science (CS1) Using Computational Creativity Exercises (CCEs),M. S. Peteranetz; A. E. Flanigan; D. F. Shell; L. -K. Soh,2018,"Contribution: This paper provides evidence that computational creativity exercises (CCEs) can increase engineering students' learning in introductory computer science (CS1) courses. Its main contribution is its more rigorous treatment/control group research design that allows testing for causal influences of CCEs on student learning and performance. Background: Computer science (CS) courses are critical foundational courses for engineering students. CCEs that merge computational and creative thinking have been shown to increase achievement and learning of engineering and nonengineering students in CS1 courses, but previous research has used quasi- and non-experimental designs. Intended Outcomes: CCEs are intended to improve students' learning of CS1 content and problem-solving ability by fostering computational creativity. Application Design: CCEs can improve student learning and can be used to supplement other evidence-based instructional practices. Findings: Propensity score matching was used to create equivalent treatment and control groups; results show that students in the CCE implementation section had higher scores on a CS knowledge test than students in the control section, but not higher self-efficacy for their CS knowledge. Focus group and open-ended survey questions indicated that students had mixed reactions to the CCEs, with about half the students seeing them as improving their learning, understanding, and ability to apply CS in their engineering field. Responses also reinforced the importance of fully incorporating CCEs in courses and aligning them with course topics.",10.1109/TE.2018.2804350,IEEE,15.0,IEEE,Achievement;computational creativity;computer science;CS1;evidence-based practice;self-efficacy,IEEE Journals,India,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering

We discuss three key kinds of coping, Wishful Thinking, Resignation and Distancing that impact an agent's beliefs, intentions and desires, and compare these coping responses to related work in the attitude change literature. We discuss the EMA computational model of emotion and identify several hypotheses it makes concerning these coping processes. We assess these hypotheses against the behavior of human subjects playing a competitive board game, using monetary gains and losses to induce emotion and coping. Subject's appraisals, emotional state and coping responses were indexed at key points throughout a game, revealing a pattern of subject's al-tering their beliefs, desires and intentions as the game unfolds.

The Unfitness of Traditional Military Thinking in Cyber,J. Kallberg; T. S. Cook,2017,"Comprehensive theories of conflict in the cyber world have not yet been developed, but the utilization of traditional military strategy and operational concepts in lieu of existing strategies in this realm can mislead, resulting in spurious assessments and unfavorable outcomes. Four tenets of the cyber world present profound challenges for the application of traditional military strategies in cyber conflicts. The cyber world is characterized by the following: 1) a lack of object permanence, which undermines the concept of maneuver; 2) limited or absent measurement of effectiveness in offensive cyber; 3) conflicts that are executed at computational speed, thus removing the time window for meaningful strategic leadership; and 4) anonymity, which makes the parties to the conflict unknown. As a result, the use of traditional military thinking and path-dependent behavior in cyber is likely to lead to incorrect conclusions regarding strategic achievements and abilities in the pre-conflict stage, and increase the risk of strategic failure during conflict and provide an opportunity for an adversary's strategic surprise.",10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2693260,IEEE,5.0,IEEE,Cyber operations;cyber defense;offensive cyber operations;information operations,IEEE Journals,Brazil,Nature Communications

Computational thinking as springboard for learning object-oriented programming in an interactive MOOC,J. Krugel; P. Hubwieser,2017,"The prerequisite knowledge regarding Computer Science (CS) varies strongly among freshmen at university and it seems advisable to compensate for these differences before the first lecture starts. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) might represent a possible solution. We therefore designed and developed a MOOC (called “LOOP: Learning Object-Oriented Programming”) which provides a gentle introduction to computational thinking and object-oriented concepts before the programming part. In addition to the common quizzes, we developed various we-based interactive exercises to enable the learners to experiment and interact directly with the presented concepts. Furthermore, we implemented programming exercises with constructive feedback for the learners using a web-based integrated development environment and additionally an automatic grading system. The target group of the course are prospective students of science or engineering that are due to attend CS lessons in their first terms. The course was conducted as a prototype with a limited number of participants. In a concluding survey, the participants submitted textual feedback on the course; some of them proposed specific improvements for the employed interactive exercises. Yet, the overall feedback was encouragingly positive. In this paper, we describe the design and the development of the course, as well as our initial results.",10.1109/EDUCON.2017.7943079,IEEE,14.0,IEEE,Computer science education;Courseware;Education courses;Educational technology;Electronic learning;Self-study courses;STEM,IEEE Conferences,France,Computers & Education

This lightning talk delves into a virtual reality education and entertainment application named Virtual Environment Interactions (VEnvI). Our in vivo study examines how VEnvI can be used to teach fundamental computer science concepts such as sequences, loops, variables, conditionals, functions, and parallel programming. We aim to reach younger students through a fun and intuitive interface for choreographing dance movements with a virtual character. Our study contrasts the highly immersive and embodied virtual reality metaphor of using VEnvI with a non-immersive desktop metaphor. Additionally, we examine the effects of user attachment by comparing the learning results gained with customizable virtual characters in contrast with character presets.

Computational thinking in elementary classrooms: Using classroom dialogue to measure equitable participation,R. Larimore; A. Yadav; K. Rich; N. Shah,2021,"The increased push for access to computer science (CS) at the K-12 level has been argued as a way to broaden participation in computing. At the elementary level, computational thinking (CT) has been used as a framework for bringing CS ideas into the classroom and educating teachers about how they can integrate CT into their daily instruction. A number of these projects have made equity a central goal of their work by working in schools with diverse racial, linguistic, and economic diversity. However, we know little about whether and how teachers equitably engage students in CT during their classroom instruction-particularly during science and math lessons. In this paper, we present an approach to analyzing classroom instructional videos using the EQUIP tool (https://www.equip.ninja/).

Sun,2015,"Almost all current matchmaking systems for team competition games based on player skill ratings contain algorithms designed to create teams consisting of players at similar skill levels. However, these systems overlook the important factor of playing style. In this paper, we analyze how playing style affects enjoyment in team competition games, using a mix of Sternberg's thinking style theory and individual histories in the form of statistics from previous matches to categorize League of Legend (LoL) players. Data for approximately 64 000 matches involving 185 000 players were taken from the LoLBase website. Match enjoyment was considered low when games lasted for 26 min or less (the earliest possible surrender time). Results from statistical analyses indicate that players with certain playing styles were more likely to enhance both game enjoyment and team strength. We also used a neural network model to test the usefulness of playing style information in predicting match quality.

Assessing conceptual understanding in mathematics,A. De Zeeuw; T. Craig; H. S. You,2013,"Modern mathematics careers are now requiring conceptual skills such as, critical thinking, modeling, and application of the content. This change in skillset needed for careers has strongly impacted mathematics curriculum and assessment. Meaningful assessment involves examining students' ability to inquire, to reason on targeted questions or tasks, and to promote conceptual understanding, not just focusing on discreet facts and principles. Mathematics assessment tools still focus solely on this procedural side of understanding mathematics instead of the equally important conceptual aspect of learning mathematics. Given that math is an active process that encourages higher-order thinking and problem solving, an assessment focusing on the growth of conceptual understanding is required. The proposed research focuses on the development of a tool that will be used to assess current U.S. calculus students' ability to apply their conceptual understanding of a mathematic concept to scientific phenomena through modeling.

The effects of emphasizing computational thinking in an introductory programming course,S. Davies,2008,"In many introductory programming courses, the surface features of the programming language can distract and intimidate students so much that they fail to concentrate on what is really the ldquobrainyrdquo task: solving the problem conceptually. To counter this, we devised a form of structured pseudocode, designed to highlight and facilitate algorithmic construction so that the complexities of the programming language can be deferred until proficiency in design has been reached. Students taught with this experimental approach are not introduced to the language itself, or the compiler, until the last few weeks of the semester. A controlled experiment comparing this approach with a traditional language-based pedagogy has revealed that by the end of the course, studentspsila programming skills, even on language-specific tasks, is every bit as strong as students taught traditionally, and that their comfort level with modularity (writing functions) is increased.

Modeling Abstract Concepts For Internet of Everything: A Cognitive Artificial System,R. Sharma; B. Ribeiro; A. M. Pinto; F. A. Cardoso,2018,"Nowadays, people, things, and processes are all connected to internet, and Internet of Everything (IoE) is addressing them conjointly. It is expected that these entities of IoE will communicate to one another, and produce a huge amount of invaluable data, thus generating a need to understand this kind of data. Computational approaches have shown their capabilities in extracting valuable information from such data. Usually these techniques focus on determining concrete concepts (particular activities such as driving, sitting, or entities like digit `1', `2' etc.). On the contrary, abstract concept identification (actions such as Motion-state, Static-state, or entity like `Number') is relatively less explored. In this article we present a methodology to model abstract representation of concepts without supervision, along with a mechanism to utilize generated models in an artificial system. Primarily, we illustrate a Regulated Activation Networks (RANs) approach that identifies abstract concepts, and dynamically builds a hierarchy to represent them. Further, we describe RANs learning, a novel way of associating concepts in two subsequent layers. We experimentally demonstrate how our approach is unsupervised, and able to model abstract activity (static-state and motion-state) of the subjects, using the Smart-phones Dataset from UCI machine learning repository for Human Activity Recognition problem.",10.1109/CONTROLO.2018.8514540,IEEE,4.0,IEEE,Unsupervised Machine Learning;Artificial Systems;Context Modeling;Computational Cognitive Modeling,IEEE Conferences,Australia,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
Computational thinking and mental models: From kodu to calypso,D. S. Touretzky,2017,"Reasoning about programs is an important component of computational thinking. Laws of computation give meaning to the formalisms in which programs are expressed, and can be used to predict or explain program behavior, or to uncover bugs. This paper presents Calypso, a language inspired by Microsoft's Kodu Game Lab but designed for programming actual mobile robots rather than characters in a virtual world. The initial implementation of Calypso uses the Cozmo robot by Anki. Like Kodu, the Calypso interpreter can be described by five key laws. An understanding of the laws and how to apply them constitutes a mental model of computation. Calypso provides a variety of affordances and scaffolding techniques to foster development of effective mental models and facilitate computational thinking.",10.1109/BLOCKS.2017.8120416,IEEE,11.0,IEEE,Cozmo robot;mobile robots;robot programming,IEEE Conferences,USA,ACM Transactions on Graphics
How Immersion and Self-Avatars in VR Affect Learning Programming and Computational Thinking in Middle School Education,D. Parmar; L. Lin; N. DSouza; S. Jörg; A. E. Leonard; S. B. Daily; S. V. Babu,2023,"We present an empirical evaluation of immersion and self-avatars as compared to desktop viewing in Virtual Reality (VR) for learning computer programming and computational thinking in middle school education using an educational VR simulation. Students were asked to programmatically choreograph dance performances for virtual characters within an educational desktop application we built earlier called Virtual Environment Interactions (VEnvI). As part of a middle school science class, 90 students from the 6th and 7th grades participated in our study. All students first visually programmed dance choreography for a virtual character they created in VEnvI on a laptop. Then, they viewed and interacted with the resulting dance performance in a between-subjects design in one of the three conditions. We compared and contrasted the benefits of embodied immersive virtual reality (EVR) viewing utilizing a head-mounted display with a body-scaled and gender-matched self-avatar, immersive virtual reality only (IVR) viewing, and desktop VR (NVR) viewing with VEnvI on pedagogical outcomes, programming performance, presence, and attitudes towards STEM and computational thinking. Results from a cognition questionnaire showed that, in the learning dimensions of Knowledge and Understanding (Bloom's taxonomy) as well as Multistructural (SOLO taxonomy), participants in EVR and IVR scored significantly higher than NVR. Also, participants in EVR scored significantly higher than IVR. We also discovered similar results in objective programming performance and presence scores in VEnvI. Furthermore, students’ attitudes towards computer science, programming confidence, and impressions significantly improved to be the highest in EVR and then IVR as compared to NVR condition. Our work suggests that educators and developers of educational VR simulations, who want to enhance knowledge and understanding as well as simultaneous acquisition of multiple abstract concepts, can do so by employing immersion and self-avatars in VR learning experiences.",10.1109/TVCG.2022.3169426,IEEE,11.0,IEEE,Computer science education;embodied cognition;immersion;self-avatars;VR in middle school education;virtual reality,IEEE Journals,USA,Nature Communications

Using Educational Robotics to Support Active Learning Experiences and Foster Computational Thinking Skills among Non-STEM University Students,V. Macko; P. Felber; K. Bergram; A. Holzer,2023,"During the last two decades educational robotics became a popular tool for teaching STEM concepts to audiences of all levels. Yet, its use for teaching programming with university-level non-STEM audiences has not been researched so far. This work presents a new educational activity designed for teaching programming to non-STEM university-level audiences. The key aspect is a separation of teaching programming concepts and programming language and; therefore, complexity reduction in learning. The concepts are introduced using educational robotics and later on students learn how to use the concepts in the context of the Python programming language. Two teaching approaches, direct instruction and productive failure, along with a capstone challenge are deployed and their relationship to educational robotics is observed.",10.1109/TALE56641.2023.10398343,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Interactive learning environments;Collaborative learning;Human Computer Interaction;Educational Robotics;Programming Education;Productive failure,IEEE Conferences,Chile,Science Advances

Technological change needs the thinking revolution essentially so the big data system is of great significance for the construction of talent training programs, implementation of competency requirements, and curriculum teaching design. This study was carried out to identify the main enablers of the big data computation (BTC) in improving the innovation capability of students majoring in business and developing a model based on the contextual relationship among the identified enablers. Initially, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify the enablers of BTC. Then, total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) was used to evolve mutual relationships among the identified 17 enablers for developing a hierarchical model. Five key driving enablers, namely data consciousness, system thinking, statistical thinking, model thinking, and analytical thinking were identified as main enablers. Image thinking played an important role in the process of data analysis and application.

VisTA: Integrating Machine Intelligence with Visualization to Support the Investigation of Think-Aloud Sessions,M. Fan; K. Wu; J. Zhao; Y. Li; W. Wei; K. N. Truong,2020,"Think-aloud protocols are widely used by user experience (UX) practitioners in usability testing to uncover issues in user interface design. It is often arduous to analyze large amounts of recorded think-aloud sessions and few UX practitioners have an opportunity to get a second perspective during their analysis due to time and resource constraints. Inspired by the recent research that shows subtle verbalization and speech patterns tend to occur when users encounter usability problems, we take the first step to design and evaluate an intelligent visual analytics tool that leverages such patterns to identify usability problem encounters and present them to UX practitioners to assist their analysis. We first conducted and recorded think-aloud sessions, and then extracted textual and acoustic features from the recordings and trained machine learning (ML) models to detect problem encounters. Next, we iteratively designed and developed a visual analytics tool, VisTA, which enables dynamic investigation of think-aloud sessions with a timeline visualization of ML predictions and input features. We conducted a between-subjects laboratory study to compare three conditions, i.e., VisTA, VisTASimple (no visualization of the ML's input features), and Baseline (no ML information at all), with 30 UX professionals. The findings show that UX professionals identified more problem encounters when using VisTA than Baseline by leveraging the problem visualization as an overview, anticipations, and anchors as well as the feature visualization as a means to understand what ML considers and omits. Our findings also provide insights into how they treated ML, dealt with (dis)agreement with ML, and reviewed the videos (i.e., play, pause, and rewind).",10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934797,IEEE,4.0,IEEE,Think-aloud;visual analytics;machine intelligence;user study;usability problems;session review behavior;UX practices,IEEE Journals,Germany,Journal of Machine Learning Research
Towards Innovative Teaching with Educational Persuasive Interfaces,R. M. Leite; R. Barwaldt; D. B. Espíndola; M.

A Framework to Overcome the Dark Side of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) Like ChatGPT in Social Media and Education,P. W. Kim,2024,"As the performance of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), such as ChatGPT, improves, content created by GAI will be distributed in the social media space, and knowledge and writings from unknown sources will be disseminated and reproduced. Now that GAI is becoming widespread, it is necessary to distinguish GAI from human intelligence, which constitutes knowledge. The data, information, knowledge, and work (DIKW) hierarchy is a useful framework for teaching and for checking metacognitive and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) literacy. There are two types of collaboration between GAI and human intelligence: a combined intelligence model and a parallel intelligence model. The combined intelligence model is a method of using GAI for creating works by collecting data, organizing information, and deriving knowledge from information. This model is suitable for GAI-assisted tasks (GAIATs). The parallel intelligence model is suitable for GAI-assisted learning (GAIAL); it is a method in which a person develops abilities by analyzing and comparing tasks created by GAI after going through the data-information-knowledge-work process. The zone of proximal development (ZPD) created by educational scaffolding is a quantitative framework that is appropriate for evaluating the effects of GAI.

Online Professional Development for High School Teachers: Building the Capacity of a National Cadre of Teachers to Broaden Participation in Computing,J. Goode; K. Peterson; J. Malyn-Smith; G. Chapman,2019,"A grand challenge of the computer science (CS) for all education movement is the preparation of thousands of teachers with high-quality, accessible professional development (PD) that has evidence of improving teacher knowledge and pedagogical practices necessary to support the learning needs of diverse groups of students. While regional PD programs can provide in-person learning opportunities, geographic and time constraints often inhibit participation of teachers, particularly educators from less densely populated communities. This experience report shares findings from an online PD program modified from the existing in-person Exploring Computer Science (ECS) PD program to provide teachers a facilitated online learning community model to support their first year teaching the course. Using two years of data collected from pre-and post-PD surveys and course participation observations, this experience involved 152 teachers from 34 states and Washington, DC. The findings reveal how the development of a facilitated learning community model of professional development, heavily based on shared experience among participants, can increase CS teachers' confidence in adapting and delivering lessons that are designed to be engaging and accessible to all students. Findings also suggest that teachers highly valued the opportunity to authentically collaborate around their common computer science course with diverse instructors from all corners of the United States. As CS education expands, the instructional environment described in this report provides an exemplar for how an online professional learning community design can concurrently build the specialized content knowledge, inclusive belief systems, and pedagogical skills of CS teachers.",10.1109/RESPECT46404.2019.8985959,IEEE,4.0,IEEE,High School Computer Science;Equity;Inquiry;Online Professional Development;CS Reform;Broadening Participation in Computing;Pedagogy;Race and Ethnicity,IEEE Conferences,Brazil,Computers & Education

Think Simulation - Think Experiment: The Virtual Cell Paradigm,I. I. Moraru; J. C. Schaff; L. M. Loew,2006,"The Virtual Cell modeling and simulation framework is the product of interdisciplinary research in biology that applies the diverse strengths and experiences of individuals from engineering, the physical sciences, the biological sciences, and mathematics. A key feature is the separation of layers (core technologies and abstractions) representing biological models, physical mechanisms, geometry, mathematical models and numerical methods. This reduces software complexity, allowing independent development and verification, but most importantly it clarifies the impact of modeling decisions, assumptions, and approximations. The result is a physically consistent, mathematically rigorous, spatial modeling and simulation framework for cell biology. The Virtual Cell has a rich, interactive user interface which connects to remote services providing scalable access to a modeling database and a large dedicated cluster for shared computation and storage.

Promoting Computer Science Learning with Block-Based Programming and Narrative-Centered Gameplay,W. Min; B. Mott; K. Park; S. Taylor; B. Akram; E. Wiebe; K. E. Boyer; J. Lester,2020,"Recent years have seen increasing awareness of the need for all students in primary and secondary education to learn computer science (CS) concepts and skills. Educational games hold significant potential to serve as a platform for CS education because they integrate engaging problem solving with effective pedagogical strategies. This potential is especially high for narrative-centered educational games that embed learning activities within rich interactive stories. In this paper, we present an educational game featuring block-based programming challenges contextualized within an engaging narrative, designed to promote CS learning for middle school students (ages 11 to 13). In the game, students undertake problem-solving challenges that are aligned with the K-12 Computer Science Framework. Results from a classroom implementation of the game with middle grade students suggest that their perceived game control ratings are positively correlated with their progress in the game, which suggests the need for adaptively supporting students' game-based learning activities. Building on these findings, we discuss design implications for creating student-adaptive CS learning experiences in educational games that incorporate block-based programming enriched narrative-centered gameplay.",10.1109/CoG47356.2020.9231881,IEEE,8.0,IEEE,Game-based learning;Computer science education;Computational thinking;Block-based programming,IEEE Conferences,China,Journal of Machine Learning Research
Breaking Visual Barriers: Advanced Neural Networks in Image Layering,N. Vasker; M. M. I. Khan; S. S. Dihan; H. A. J. M. Tamim,2024,"This study explores the full potential of burst photography, a method that captures brief moments in a flood of pictures. However, the beauty of these frames is typically obscured by undesired blemishes such as occlusions and reflections. We address these restrictions by combining deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and adaptive neural splines, which surpass traditional image fusion and reveal the hidden brilliance inside. Acting like skilled artisans, the adaptive neural splines deftly separate and reweave the image's fabric. Their subtle touch safeguards every strand of visual information, ensuring the final result is a harmonious tapestry of enhanced clarity and preserved detail. This harmonic connection reveals itself in a transforming process that combines many frames into a single, stunning tapestry. Shadows reveal their secrets, the previously opaque depths now shining with clarity. Occlusions and reflections evaporate, leaving just a spotless canvas on which the scene's genuine brightness shines. The result is a symphony of increased clarity, with minute details emerging from darkness and textures dancing with unparalleled sharpness. The power of this invention is not just theoretical. Extensive comparisons to cutting-edge approaches demonstrate its revolutionary influence. Our model outperforms others in retaining fine detail, improving overall clarity, and maintaining visual integrity. These breakthroughs not only push the frontiers of computational photography but also serve as a catalyst for future advances in image processing and analysis. This study shows that creative thinking unleashes the power of visuals.

Fuzzy learning performance assessment based on decision making under internal uncertainty,S. Prokhorov; I. Kulikovskikh,2015,"The paper delves into decision making with partial knowledge focused on students' behaviour in multiple-choice testing. To address to this problem, we first provided a binary knowledge model and, then, relaxing some assumptions, allowed for the more realistic framework of partial knowledge which, in turn, adds uncertainty to the assessment of students' knowledge due to their incentive to make a guess in multiple-choice testing. The aim of this paper is to propose a fuzzy assessment model formalised according to Reiter's Theory of Diagnosis to reduce this uncertainty and to draw a distinction between the level of students' ability and the degree of guessing. The provided assessment model was tested on modelled answers with respect to the knowledge frameworks and validated in a real-world context. The findings of this research present the fuzzy learning performance assessment model which may enable a teacher to estimate the level of partial knowledge and, thus, to specify a student's score as well as the results of computational experiments that confirm the validity of the theoretical outcomes.",10.1109/CEEC.2015.7332701,IEEE,1.0,IEEE,Adaptive learning;Bloom's taxonomy;decision making;internal uncertainty;multiple-choice testing;fuzzy logic,IEEE Conferences,Australia,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
A big data approach to computational creativity: The curious case of Chef Watson,L. R. Varshney; F. Pinel; K. R. Varshney; D. Bhattacharjya; A. Schörgendorfer; Y. . -M. Chee,2019,"Computational creativity is an emerging branch of artificial intelligence that places computers in the center of the creative process. Broadly, creativity involves a generative step to produce many ideas and a selective step to determine the ones that are the best. Many previous attempts at computational creativity, however, have not been able to achieve a valid selective step. This paper shows how bringing data sources from the creative domain and from hedonic psychophysics together with machine learning and data analytics techniques can overcome this shortcoming to yield a system that can produce novel and high-quality creative artifacts. To demonstrate our data-driven approach, we developed and deployed a computational creativity system for culinary recipes and menus, Chef Watson, which can operate either autonomously or semiautonomously with human interaction. We present the basic system architecture, data engineering, and algorithms that are involved. Experimental results demonstrate the system passes the test for creativity based on the consensual assessment technique, producing a novel and flavorful recipe.

Using Visualization to Reduce the Cognitive Load of Threshold Concepts in Computer Programming,V. Winter; M. Friend; M. Matthews; B. Love; S. Vasireddy,2019,"This Full Paper in the Research to Practice Category reports on an empirical empirical study in which novel educational tools and techniques were employed to teach fundamentals of problem decomposition - a cognitive task transcending disciplines. Within the discipline of computer science, problem decomposition is recognized as a foundational activity of software development. Factors that contribute to the complexity of this activity include: (1) recognizing patterns within an algorithm, (2) mapping the understanding of an algorithm to the syntax of a given programming language, and (3) complexity intrinsic to the problem domain itself. Cognitive load theory states that learning outcomes can be positively affected by reducing the extraneous cognitive load associated with learning objectives as well as by changing the nature of what is learned. In the study reported upon here, a novel instructional method was developed to decrease students' cognitive load. Novel instructional content supported by a custom visualization tool was used in a classroom setting in order to help novice programmers develop an understanding of function-based problem decomposition within the context of a visual domain. Performance on outcome measures (a quiz and assignment) were compared between the new method and the traditional teaching method demonstrated that students were significantly more successful at demonstrating mastery when using the new instructional method.",10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028612,IEEE,3.0,IEEE,computational thinking;mathematical thinking;visual thinking;spatial reasoning;functional programming,IEEE Conferences,Chile,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
Systems Thinking in Software Projects-an Artificial Neural Network Approach,Z. M. Mitrović; A. M. Rakićević; D. č. Petrović; M. M. Mihić; J. Ð. Rakićević; E. T. Jelisić,2020,"The authors discuss why the current conceptual base of project management research and practice continues to attract criticism since it does not adequately address the complexity that leads to software-project failure. To do so, the study explores systems thinking and artificial neural networks to shed light on complexity in software-project behavior using nonlinear functional relationships between critical success factors and project success to utilize their connectedness as an approach in order to create project-outcome prediction models. The artificial neural networks were used to create two project-outcome prediction models: one for a binary classification task to discriminate failed from successful projects using a multi-input-single-output configuration and one for a multi-task binary classification to discriminate success from failure in multiple project-success dimensions using a multi-input multi-output configuration. The results yielded high-performance values for a binary classification task, performed to predict overall project success, and slightly lower performance values for the multi-task binary classification, which was also performed to predict success in project-success dimensions. It was found that the nonlinear behavior of critical success factors may be used to create prediction models, by embedding equifinality and connectedness constructs that prove to be useful to understand projects as complex, multi-loop, and nonlinear systems. Further research is needed to investigate the causality between critical success factors in order to explore the possible propagation of critical success factors within a project system network and its implications on project success.",10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3040169,IEEE,13.0,IEEE,Artificial neural networks;critical success factors;project success;prediction models;systems thinking,IEEE Journals,France,ACM Transactions on Graphics
Teaching Structured Authoring and DITA Through Rhetorical and Computational Thinking,C. Evia; M. R. Sharp; M. A. Pérez-Quiñones,2015,"Background: The diffusion of component content management and structured authoring workflows and technologies in technical communication requires that instructors of documentation courses determine effective ways to teach component content management to students who may initially be intimidated by authoring environments and structures, such as the Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA). This teaching case describes how component content management and DITA were integrated into the Creating User Documentation course of an undergraduate professional writing program. Research questions: How can instructors of technical and professional writing best teach English and humanities students to operate within a structured authoring workflow? How can computational abstraction be combined with students' previously acquired genre knowledge to ease their adoption of the DITA to create technical documentation? Situating the case: The development of this course was informed by literature from a variety of scholarly and industry sources, which reveal connections between DITA, computational thinking, and Rhetorical Genre theory. Specifically, the concept of “layers of abstraction” guides the development of the course's structure, allowing students to separate and independently process the various aspects of a structured authoring workflow. How the case was studied: The case was studied informally through the experience of the authors as they developed and taught the course, through informal discussions and structured interviews with industry professionals, and through student reflections from discussion forum posts from Fall 2012 through Fall 2013. About the case: Initially developed with a focus on print manuals and online help, the course began teaching topic-based authoring in the mid-2000s; however, most enterprise-level editors and tools were cost-prohibitive for students and faculty. Furthermore, many computing concepts associated with structured authoring were intimidating for an audience of students in an English department. An affordable solution was adopting the open-source DITA standard, using free trials or open-source editors. The intimidation factor was minimized by designing the course around five layers of abstraction that draw on students' previous rhetorical knowledge: Layer 1: Developing quality documentation, Layer 2: Separating content from design, Layer 3: Authoring granular content with XML, Layer 4: Authoring and linking Component Content Management modules with DITA, and Layer 5: Single-sourcing and content reuse. This case discusses each layer of abstraction, the associated assignments for each layer, and the results of each layer based on student feedback. Results and conclusions: Although the course is not universally loved by students, it has seen many successes and provides a much-needed foundation in component content management and structured authoring for students who might become technical communicators. The teaching team has learned to avoid overemphasizing coding and automation in structured authoring, maintain a solid grounding on writing principles and good technical communication requirements, and draw upon students' existing knowledge of genres and their constraints.",10.1109/TPC.2016.2516639,IEEE,22.0,IEEE,Abstractions;computer languages;DITA;documentation;rhetoric;standards;writing;XML,IEEE Journals,Spain,PLOS ONE

To confirm it we conducted a quasi-experiment with students who were enrolled at a first programming course (CS1). We analysed their mathematical knowledge through a test and gathered information on their difficulties and strategies used to overcome their programming difficulties. The data sample was too small to allow for strong assertions. However, the results indicates a possible correlation between mathematical abilities and programming potential.

Basic theories for neuroinformatics and neurocomputing,Y. Wang,2013,"Summary form only given. A fundamental challenge for almost all scientific disciplines is to explain how natural intelligence is generated by physiological organs and what the logical model of the brain is beyond its neural architectures. According to cognitive informatics and abstract intelligence, the exploration of the brain is a complicated recursive problem where contemporary denotational mathematics is needed to efficiently deal with it. Cognitive psychology and medical science were used to explain that the brain works in a certain way based on empirical observations on related activities in usually overlapped brain areas. However, the lack of precise models and rigorous causality in brain studies has dissatisfied the formal expectations of researchers in computational intelligence and mathematics, because a computer, the logical counterpart of the brain, might not be explained in such a vague and empirical approach without the support of formal models and rigorous means. In order to fonnally explain the architectures and functions of the brain, as well as their intricate relations and interactions, systematic models of t he brain are s ought for revealing the principles and mechanisms of the brain at the neural, physiological, cognitive, and logical (abstract) levels. Cognitive and brain informatics investigate into the brain via not only inductive syntheses through these four cognitive levels from the bottom up in order to form theories based on empirical observations, but also deductive analyses from the top down in order to explain various functional and behavioral instances according to the abstract intelligence theory. This keynote lecture presents systematic models of the brain from the facets of cognitive informatics, abstract intelligence, brain Informatics, neuroinformatics, and cognitive psychology. A logical model of the brain is introduced that maps the cognitive functions of the brain onto its neural and physiological architectures. This work leads to a coherent abstract intelligence theory based on both denotational mathematical models and cognitive psychology observations, which rigorously explains the underpinning principles and mechanisms of the brain. On the basis of the abstract intelligence theories and the logical models of the brain, a comprehensive set of cognitive behaviors as identified in the Layered Reference Model of the Brain (LRMB) such as perception, inference and learning can be rigorously explained and simulated.The logical model of the brain and the abstract intelligence theory of natural intelligence will enable the development of cognitive computers that perceive, think and learn. The functional and theoretical difference between cognitive computers and classic computers are that the latter are data processors based on Boolean algebra and its logical counterparts; while the former are knowledge processors based on contemporary denotational mathematics.

Teachers' attitudes towards implementing coding at schools,H. Bučková; J. Dostál,2019,"The process of implementing coding at schools attended by pupils from six to fourteen years of age is a current trend in developed countries. In some cases, simple activities involving coding might be even included at kindergartens attended by children from three years of age. The crucial aim is to develop the so-called computational thinking which is going to be more and more essential for a successful personal and professional development of every individual. There is a broad range of factors influencing the success of the change in the curriculum, which is, inter alia, supposed to include coding. In addition to the necessary teaching aids and know-how, teachers also need to have positive attitudes towards its implementation. The main objective of our research is to identify teachers' attitudes towards introducing coding to their classes. We discovered that not all teachers of computing agree with including algorithmization and coding in their teaching. Approximately one half of the questioned educators hold a negative attitude towards the curricular change; they would rather continue teaching computer user skills and basic programs. Their attitude proves to be an impediment to a successful curricular change as teachers should fully grasp the teaching content and communicate it with enthusiasm to their pupils.

Next Bar Predictor: An Architecture in Automated Music Generation,B. M. Dungan; P. L. Fernandez,2020,"Music generation has been an active field of research in computer science and is considered as a creative task attempting to imitate human creativity. With the different approaches to generate musical content, recent works have focused on general adversarial networks. One of these is the Midinet, which is considered the baseline model in this study. In this paper, we propose our Next Bar Predictor, a generative model that creates melody one bar at a time using the previous bar as basis to generate aesthetically pleasing melodies. We explore several variants of this by experimenting on different regression and classification models such as Decision Trees (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The models were trained using the dataset from Theorytab which consists of 460 songs. The outputs of these different variant models were then compared against those from the Midinet, using both machine-based objective scoring mechanism as well as human-based subjective evaluations. The dissimilarity scores obtained by our KNN (0.65) and DT (0.74) models, scored against the melodies in the dataset, are sufficiently high and indicates that both models are generally creative. Furthermore, based on the evaluation by human listeners, the melodies generated by our DT models are more realistic and pleasing than those of the Midinet. Casual listeners also prefer the DT model to be more interesting, although professional listeners think otherwise. Finally, all the variant models, when compared with Midinet, require much less training time and computational power. The proposed Next Bar Predictor is therefore a viable alternative for automated music generation.",10.1109/ICCSP48568.2020.9182341,IEEE,1.0,IEEE,Computer generated music;machine learning;artificial intelligence,IEEE Conferences,Mexico,Nature Communications
Trust-based situation awareness: Agent-based versus population-based modeling a comparative study,Z. Nasar; S. W.

Situation Awareness (SA) in general is regarded as basis for efficient group decision making while trust based situation awareness is of utmost importance in safety critical systems as the trust is a key factor that tend to affect the beliefs of agents that are collaborating in an environment. In this study an existing model of situation awareness is extended to incorporate mutual trust of the participating agents. The proposed model is analyzed using two different paradigms of computational modeling techniques namely Agent Based Modeling (ABM) and Population Based Modeling (PBM). Various experiments are conducted using variety of populations. Results show that with incorporation of trust factor, both approaches show similar patterns with large population size.

Cognitive computing and World Wide Wisdom (WWW+),Y. Wang,2010,"It is recognized that the key theoretical and technical problems toward the next generation internet are not only a speed issue, but also a more fundamental issue of the increasingly demands for the sharing of computational intelligent capabilities. According to cognitive informatics [1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 14, 16, 18], the cognitive information that humans acquire, process, retain, and share can be classified into four profound forms known as knowledge, experience, skill, and wisdom. Among them, wisdom is the most advanced cognitive objects, which is a form of natural intelligence of humans that transfers a query or instruction into an action or behavior based on a well developed reasoning and judgment. However, the current Internet is still remains as an information network. Towards the development of next generation Internet as a wisdom network, the World Wide Wisdom (WWW+) network infrastructures and technologies are yet to be sough t on the basis of cognitive informatics and cognitive computers. In WWW+, each node is a cognitive computer (CC) [3, 9, 10, 15], which is a form of autonomous and intelligent computers that think, perceive, and learn. CC enables the simulation of machinable thought such as computational inferences, reasoning, and causality analyses by autonomous inferences and perceptions mimicking the mechanisms of the brain [3, 15]. The cognitive learning engine of a CC is an autonomous learning system that enables machines learn in natural languages and symbolic notations. The cognitive search engine of a CC is a machine-learning-based search system that results in cognitive knowledge acquisitions and manipulations. On the basis of the development of CCs, the next generation internet, WWW+, will be developed as a world-wide intelligent network for knowledge processing, autonomous learning, and machine-supported problem solving. The theoretical foundations for WWW+ and cognitive computing are cognitive informatics [1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 14, 16, 18], with underpinning contemporary denotational mathematics [6, 12], such as concept algebra [7], system algebra [17], realtime process algebra [4, 8], granular algebra [12], and visual semantic algebra [11]. Denotational mathematics provides a coherent set of powerful mathematical means and explicit expressive power for the design, modeling, and implementation of cognitive computers and WWW+, as that of Boolean algebra for conventional computing technologies. WWW+ extends the current information-search-based Internet to wisdom providing and intelligence services that mimic and simulate the brain in the largest scope of the cyberspace in which each node plays a role as an autonomous super neural cell. As that the conventional Internet provides a solution to the “to be” category of problems for information sharing based on searching technologies, the WWW+-based internet solves the advanced “to do” category of problems for wisdom and intelligence capability sharing based on cognitive computing technologies. WWW+ will be the largest scope of computational intelligence and the closest embodiment of the brain as interconnected constituent intelligent components. A wide range of applications of WWW+ and cognitive computers have been identified such as, inter alia, theories, methodologies, and infrastructures of collective intelligence, networks of computational intelligence, services providing networks, distributed agent networks, distributed cognitive sensor networks, and distributed remote control systems.",10.1109/COGINF.2010.5599737,IEEE,17.0,IEEE,Cognitive informatics;abstract intelligence;world-wide wisdom;WWW+;cognitive computing;cognitive computers;computational intelligence;denotational mathematics;next generation internet,IEEE Conferences,Japan,Nature Communications
Young People's Descriptions of Computational Rules in Role-Playing Games: An Empirical Study,J. Good; K. Howland; K. Nicholson,2010,"A study was carried out which examined the extent to which young people aged 11-12, with no prior instruction in programming, are able to write computational rules which govern play in a 3D computer role-playing game. Expressing these rules required the use of common computational structures such as conditionals, sets and loops. We analysed the rules written for their structure and style, and recorded the types of errors made. It was found that although young people were able to abstract away from the game play experience, very few of the rules were error-free. The most common errors were errors of omission (leaving elements out that should have been included) rather than errors of commission (including elements which should not be part of the rule). These findings have implications for the design of the Flip language, which aims to support young people as they begin to develop computational skills through game design.",10.1109/VLHCC.2010.18,IEEE,11.0,IEEE,novice programmers;computational rules;empirical studies,IEEE Conferences,Japan,Nature Communications

What goals do they have, what do they want to achieve in their lives? Are human relationships important to them? As our interviewees were marketing students, we asked them if they were happy buying a product or using a service, how important is the experience of buying a product or service to them? How do they think about this topic, what strategy do they want to follow as marketing employees based on their life experiences?

"Interpreting the Meaning of Agility, Perceiving its Individual Importance Through the Eyes of Different Generations1",Á. Csiszárik-Kocsir; J. Varga,2024,"Agility - like the XXI. one of the fashionable concepts and leading approaches of the 20th century - it came into the spotlight after the 2000s. At first, as a new project management methodology, it was included in the thinking, which is able to eliminate the shortcomings and slowness of the classic waterfall model, thus making project management more efficient, directing them towards successful projects. Seeing the success of agile project management, more and more companies and businesses began to agileize their various organizational units as well, and finally the mindset spread to the whole organization. Today, we interpret the concept of agility not only at the organizational level, but also at the individual level. However, the willingness of individuals and employees to agility differs along a number of factors. It is influenced by an individual's age, generation affiliation, education, culture, which determines the extent to which he or she is able to embrace this new way of thinking. In our study, we look for the answer to what agility means as a term in the reading of respondents of each generation.

Simulating the Cognitive Thought Process with a Modified Genetic Algorithm,P. A. Gadekar; S. V. Tikhe,2021,"Cognitive Computing is a developing paradigm with its applications found in almost every field. It aims to develop computing methodologies and systems inspired by mind’s capabilities. A thought is the most fundamental capability of the mind. Hence it is important in the cognitive computing to understand the Thought Process. The purpose of this paper is to develop a computer model that simulates the Thought Process. The paper proposes that the Genetic Algorithm (GA) can be used for the same. Both cognitive model and computer model of the thought process with the help of GA has been given. In the computer model, a modification of GA has been implemented, which consists of a new crossover operator called Learning Crossover operator. The new crossover operator is not a replacement but is a supplement to the existing crossover operators. The GA is implemented over the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP), which is a classical NP problem and hence the algorithm is possible to be implemented on any other problem. The modification to the GA aims to improve the Thought Process Simulation. But it can also improve the performance of GA, when further explored.",10.1109/AIMV53313.2021.9670980,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Cognitive Computing;Genetic Algorithm;Traveling Salesperson Problem;Thought Process;Natural Selection,IEEE Conferences,Canada,Nature Communications

Evaluating the Aesthetics of Endgame Studies: A Computational Model of Human Aesthetic Perception,A. Iqbal; H. van der Heijden; M. Guid; A. Makhmali,2012,"In this paper, we explain how an existing computational aesthetics model for three-move mate problems was improved and adapted to suit the domain of chess endgame studies. Studies are typically longer and more “sophisticated” in terms of their perceived aesthetics or beauty. They are therefore likely a better test of the capability of machines to evaluate beauty in the game. Based on current validation methods for an aesthetics model such as this, the experimental results confirm that the adaptation was successful. In the first experiment, the new model enabled a computer program to distinguish correctly between composed studies and positions with sequences resembling studies taken from real games. In the second, the computational aesthetic evaluations were shown to correlate positively and well with human expert aesthetic assessment. The new model encompasses the previous three-mover one and can be used to evaluate beauty as perceived by humans in both domains. This technology pushes the boundaries of computational chess and can be of benefit to human players, composers, and judges. To some extent, it may also contribute to our understanding of the psychology of human aesthetic perception and the “mechanics” of human creativity in composing problems and studies.",10.1109/TCIAIG.2012.2192933,IEEE,12.0,IEEE,Aesthetics;chess;creativty;endgame;perception,IEEE Journals,China,Computers & Education

Exploring computational thinking assessment in introductory programming courses,A. L. S. O. Araujo; J. S. Santos; W. L. Andrade; D. D. S. Guerrero; V. Dagienė,2017,"Several instruments have been used for assessing Computational Thinking (CT) abilities. In this exploratory and preliminary study, we investigate how appropriate the Bebras challenge is as an instrument to assess and measure CT abilities. Bebras is an international challenge whose goal is to promote Computer Science and CT. The test can be answered without any prior knowledge on computer science. Our broad research question is whether we can evolve Bebras into a full fledged instrument to assess and measure CT abilities. In this paper, we instantiate a few more specific research questions: Is Bebras performance a good predictor of success for students within programming courses? Is there any correlation between Bebras performance and students' grades? Do students improve their performance in Bebras tests when exposed to the contents of a programming course? Our dataset consists of the grades of 138 students who attended introductory programming courses at two Brazilian universities and their performance in two simulated Bebras tests. The first test was applied at the beginning of the term and therefore before any exposition to programming classes. The second one was applied at the end of the term. The results suggest that the performance on Bebras is only moderately correlated to the student grades. We conclude that it is not very likely that CT measures can be derived from the Bebras test as it is currently designed. While further research is needed on how we can leverage the Bebras effort to extend it into a CT assessment instrument, we performed a preliminary study on the use of Item Response Theory (IRT) as a means to improve the selection of questions and the design of the test. We expect the results of this research can contribute both to the development and discussion on CT assessment as well as to the Bebras effort to educate CT.",10.1109/FIE.2017.8190652,IEEE,20.0,IEEE,,IEEE Conferences,Chile,Journal of Computer Science

Synthesis of Liveness-Enforcing Petri Net Supervisors Based on a Think-Globally-Act-Locally Approach and Vector Covering for Flexible Manufacturing Systems,C. Li; Y. Chen; Z. Li; K. Barkaoui,2017,"This paper proposes the synthesis of Petri net supervisors based on a think-globally-actlocally (TGAL) approach and a vector covering technique for flexible manufacturing systems. Given a Petri net model with deadlocks, the TGAL approach first temporarily adds a global idle place (GP). A GP has initially only one token. Then, we generate the reachability graph of the net model with the GP. If there are deadlocks, we find all the legal markings and first-met bad markings (FBMs). The legal markings and FBMs that need to be considered can be reduced by using a vector covering approach. An integer linear programming problem is formulated to design a set of control places to forbid all FBMs but no legal markings. Meanwhile, the redundancy of the obtained control places is checked to remove the redundant ones. Then, we increase one token in the GP and compute a set of control place again. This process is carried out until the reachable markings of the Petri net model do not increase when the number of tokens in the GP is increased. As a result, we can find a set of control places to make the Petri net model live. Finally, some Petri net examples from the literature are used to demonstrate the proposed methods. It can be verified that the obtained supervisors can lead to more reachable markings, since the obtained control places are maximally permissive at each iteration.",10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2720630,IEEE,5.0,IEEE,Flexible manufacturing system;Petri net;deadlock prevention;think-globally-act-locally approach;maximally permissive supervisor,IEEE Journals,France,Journal of Machine Learning Research

Utilizing a Data analytics project to increase student awareness of contemporary global issues,R. Ravikumar; P. Sadhwani,2020,"Computational thinking is irrefutably a must-have skill in today's digital world. This is why it is a requisite course in most college curricula. Computational thinking is a broad term encompassing fundamental concepts of computing such as formulating problems and expressing their solutions in computational steps that can be processed by a computer. The ability to organize and analyze data is also a part of computational thinking. Following this paradigm, educational institutions have adopted various methods to teach computational thinking including programming. This paper will explore a specific project within the computational thinking course taught as an introductory course in all major programs at the Higher Colleges of Technology in the United Arab Emirates. The intention of the paper is to demonstrate how a project-based data analytics assessment in such a course can be used to foster in students, a greater awareness of a contemporary and critical global issue such as waste management. To examine the effectiveness of this project, the paper documents and evaluates the work of a group of students who carried out data analysis on secondary data collected from a notable website on “waste management”. The methodology implemented for this task is developed based on a prescribed course syllabus and assessment structure which promotes student-centered and inter-disciplinary learning.",10.1109/ASET48392.2020.9118395,IEEE,2.0,IEEE,inter-disciplinary learning;cross-curricular;project-based learning;data analytics;coding;computer programming;global issues;waste management;computational thinking;engineering;digital;Python;academic;curriculum,IEEE Conferences,Mexico,Journal of Computer Science
An Integration of Indian Philosophy and Machine Learning for Human-like Cognition,A. Sha; A. R. Inture; J. Joseph; P. P. M. Nair; M. J. Sheeba; A. T,2023,"This paper introduces a novel framework that melds the profound tenets of Indian philosophy with AI and ML. Our goal is to create models that replicate human cognition, paving the way for robots that think like us. Key concepts from Indian philosophy, including ”buddhi,” ”manas,” ”chit,” and ”ahamkar,” are woven into the framework, enhancing AI’s ability to understand and interact with the world in a more human-like way. The core of the framework consists of ”Buddhi” and ”Manas.” Buddhi, a discriminative AI component, adeptly navigates sensory data, making decisions aligned with human discernment. Complementing it, ”Manas” is a generative core, capable of crafting narratives and generating creative solutions. This synergy creates an iterative loop that encapsulates human thought, enabling machines to think, visualize, and even dream. In addition to advancing AI and ML research, we conducted an experiment using a modified News Aggregator dataset from the UCI repository. The experiment focused on word prediction, and our model, infused with Indian philosophy, outperformed RNN and LSTM models over 30 epochs. This framework has the potential to revolutionize AI and create more human-like machines, ushering in a new era of AI and robotics.",10.1109/ICACRS58579.2023.10404103,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Artificial Intelligence;Machine Learning;Model of mind;Human way of thought,IEEE Conferences,Argentina,Nature Communications

Sparse direct matrix solvers of finite element discretizations in electromagnetics,M. N. Vouvakis; J. Moshfegh,2018,"The paper outlines some direct solution strategies for sparse matrices arising from the finite element (FE) discretization of electromagnetic (EM) models, and explores whether the conventional thinking followed by highly optimized direct method tools for sparse matrices is indeed the best available option for directly solving FEM problems in EM. Factorization memory and time, solution time, parallelization potential, and error will be considered in the comparisons between approaches. Drawing from advances in the area of integral equation (IE) methods that rely on relatively small but dense matrices, we will conjecture that direct solvers that minimize factorization fill-in while maintaining sparsity may not lead to the best overall strategy after all. We present an direct solution algorithm for FEM, based on domain decomposition that generates and operates on a lesser sparse matrix with block-wise sparse pattern, thus bridging the gap between the two extreme matrix structures, (a large fully sparse encountered in FEM and a smaller fully dense encountered in IE methods). Early results on 3D arbitrary tetrahedron meshes and arbitrary volumetric geometries suggest that the proposed approach significantly outperform state-of-the-art sparse matrix direct solvers in terms of memory while maintaining competitive run times for serial implementations.",10.23919/ROPACES.2018.8364197,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Numerical Linear Algebra;Sparse Matrix Direct Methods;Finite Element Methods,IEEE Conferences,France,Computers & Education
On the fusion and transference of knowledge. II,S. H. Rubin,2003,"Progress in AI (artificial intelligence) is bottlenecked by contemporary thinking. Soft computing methodologies recognize the fundamental role of imprecision in any computational intelligence. This paper goes one step further in that it recognizes the fundamental need for heuristics - both as a generalization of numeric imprecision according to S.H. Rubin (1999) and, as a consequence, of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem by V.A. Uspenskii (1987). Heuristic ontologies were compared with logical ontologies and shown to be advantageous for the realization of intelligent computation. It was also noted how the mechanics of evolutionary biology and that presupposed for thought can be computationally equivalent. In particular, randomness and symmetry by G.J. Chaitin (1975) are shown to underpin computational evolution by providing for heuristic discovery, knowledge transference and creative computation. The capability for the transference of heuristic knowledge was evidenced to be fundamental to the evolution of what M. Minsky (1987) has termed, ""a society of mind"". The need for transformational representations of this knowledge was demonstrated by S. Amarel (1968). A modeling language, designed to exploit domain symmetries, was characterized for the game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Applications to UAVs and intelligent agents - among a plethora of others - will follow. In conclusion, Marvin Minsky argues that many AI researchers seem to have lost their way in recent years and should be investigating core problems such as how a person reasons according to C.T. Clark. It is hoped that this paper will sow the seeds for a proper response to Minsky's admonition by inciting a restoration in the type of creative thinking that attracted many AI researchers into the field in the first place.",10.1109/IRI.2003.1251408,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,,IEEE Conferences,Chile,ACM Transactions on Graphics
Modelling The Fitness Landscapes of a SCRaMbLEd Yeast Genome,B. Yang; G. Misirli; A. Wipat; J. Hallinan,2021,"The use of microorganisms for the production of industrially important compounds and enzymes is becoming increasingly important. Eukaryotes have been less widely used than prokaryotes in biotechnology, because of the complexity of their genomic structure and biology. The Yeast2.0 project is an international effort to engineer the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to make it easy to manipulate, and to generate random variants using a system called SCRaMbLE. SCRaMbLE relies on artificial evolution in vitro to identify useful variants, an approach which is time consuming and expensive. We developed an in silico simulator for the SCRaMbLE system, using an evolutionary computing approach, which can be used to investigate and optimize the fitness landscape of the system. We applied the system to the investigation of the fitness landscape of one of the S. cerevisiae chromosomes, and found that our results fitted well with those previously published. Our simulator can be applied to the analysis of the fitness landscapes of any organism for which SCRaMbLE has been implemented.",10.1109/CIBCB49929.2021.9562918,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,SCRaMbLE;yeast;simulation;fitness landscape,IEEE Conferences,Italy,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
Fuzzy logic-based sport activity risk assessment framework optimization,E.

This requirement is fulfilled by the risk assessment framework published by the author and her colleagues. However, it is also equally important to obtain the accurate result in time to avoid the serious consequences. In order to address this problem in this paper the author presents some evaluation structure reduction techniques which reduce the computational need of the risk assessment.

Computational Creativity by Generative Adversial Network with Leaked Information,S. Ghosh; A. Konar; A. K. Nagar,2024,"Computational creativity is defined as the ability of artificial systems to generate artifacts with substantial novelty and originality, comparable to those crafted by human experts. This study introduces an innovative approach to implementing computational creativity in the scientific domain, exemplified through the automatic generation of trigonometric identities using a novel LeakGAN model, a Generative Adversarial Network with leaked information. The novelty of the proposed LeakGAN lies in its discriminator model, constructed on the foundation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), aimed at capturing the most relevant features from input data. These features are subsequently leaked to the generator model, enabling the production of identities with substantial originality and quality. The introduced novelty in the discriminator’s architecture encompasses the use of a new activation function called Mish, strategically employed to enhance the network's convergence rate and address over-fitting issues during training. Additionally, an attention layer is introduced to highlight the most relevant information within the feature space, thereby improving the network's learning capacity. Furthermore, a unique mixed pooling layer is utilized, combining the advantageous effects of max-pooling and average pooling operations to enhance the network's adaptability to varying feature distributions. Performance analysis, incorporating BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) metrics and various comparative studies, substantiates the efficacy of the proposed LeakGAN model in generating novel identities compared to its traditional counterparts. Moreover, human evaluation involving 20 mathematical experts confirms the significant novelty of the generated identities compared to existing standard textbook problems. Consequently, the proposed technique proves valuable for generating diverse trigonometric identities suitable for inclusion as chapter-end exercises in middle school mathematics textbooks.",10.1109/IJCNN60899.2024.10650943,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,computational creativity;LeakGAN;trigonometric identities;CNN,IEEE Conferences,Japan,ACM Transactions on Graphics
Deployment of physics simulation apps using Easy JavaScript Simulations,,2017,"Physics simulations are widely used to improve the learning process in science and engineering education. Deployment of a computational physics simulation/model is extremely complex given the fact that both knowledge and skills for the science equations and the computational and programming aspects are required for a fully functional simulation, typically requiring a science educator and computer scientists/developer to work together. However, when using Easy JavaScript Simulation (EjsS) modeling toolkit, the instructor can be both the science educator and computer programmer, only needing to define the simulation variables, model and view, and the modeling toolkit can generate the computer codes for the physics simulation. Moreover, the programming aspects can become even more complex if simulations require being optimized for both Android and iOS mobile devices. The current version of EjsS provides instructors with an authoring tool that includes facilities for the creation of such JavaScript simulations as mobile apps, thus simplifying the purely programming aspects. This paper presents a new and novel EjsS functionality to generate physics simulation apps for iOS and Android. The generation process is based on the integration of the Ionic/Cordova and AngularJS technologies into EjsS.

A Hierarchical Computational Model Inspired by the Behavioral Control in the Primate Brain,D. Shi; J. Kralik; H. Mi,2020,"The basic cognitive architecture of our brain is still unknown. However, scientists have found evidence for existence of distinct behavioral control systems shared by humans and nonhumans. Inspired by the problem solving systems of the behavioral control in the primate brain, a hierarchical computational model is presented. We focus on the integrative performance of brain substructures, each of which is represented by a problem solver that is further modeled by a certain algorithm. Different levels of brain substructures, as well as the corresponding algorithms, are hierarchically organized both in structure and in function, including how and when higher-order solvers control lower-order ones. Different problem solvers share a same slice of working memory. This novelty is claimed since most of existing brain models emphasize on the neural network structure even though the neuron dynamics of brain is still very controversial. And we compare its performance to three other computational models in the face of a challenging foraging problem. Agents are examined in foraging environment with different sizes, and/or transparent barriers. The experimental results show that our model performed the best outright in most scenarios.

Relevance of modeling laser-material interactions in the industrial context,W. Schulz,2017,"Implementing a virtual production system is challenging. Production systems are constrained by different dynamical market changes and characterised by complex general and machine specific interactions, uncertainties and unknowns. These complications make predicting the behaviour by any deterministic computer model not only inaccurate but sometimes misleading, e.g. if the range of a model's applicability is not sufficiently well identified. Thus it is crucial to implement a virtual production system that supports learning from data and existing knowledge in the iterative design of models and their range of applicability - such a systematic design approach integrates real versus virtual data with digital versus human creativity and intelligence. The theory of design oriented thinking adapted for manufacturing favours fast iteration in digitised design cycles instead of optimisation of model quality in one step.",,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,,IEEE Conferences,Chile,Nature Communications

The major goal of the first part is to create a new way of thinking about politics and economy, viewing them from a different perspective, not only as humanity disciplines but also considering engineering and computational patterns in these sciences. Next, we focus on designing an integrated intelligent government (IIG) by partitioning a government's structure into different intelligent agents which use diverse knowledge bases and inference methodologies. Finally, we illustrate the role of electronic technology in a novel governing framework from various angles and come up with new ideas in this regard to develop participation, democratization, etc by an international electronic government (IEG)",10.1109/CCECE.2006.277732,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Computational Politics;Integrated Intelligent Government;International Electronic Government,IEEE Conferences,Mexico,Computers & Education
Cultivating Positive ICT Perceptions: an application of the MST-tree model to the ‘Guyanese Girls Code’ Initiative,A. Layne; P. DeFreitas; J. Marks; R. Lackhan,2020,"Globally, women account for a small percentage of students and professionals in ICT-related fields. In order to increase female participation in this area, governments worldwide have been facilitating targeted interventions. One such initiative is the ‘Guyanese Girls Code’ (GGC) training program. This program was launched in 2018 with the aim of using Scratch and the BBC micro:bit to introduce girls at the Grade 7 to 9 levels to ICT education. In this paper, we propose a novel teaching model, the ‘Motivation, Support and Teaching Components’ tree model (MST-tree model). This model was critical to the design of GGC’s curriculum and teaching strategies. An evaluation was conducted to gather information on the program participants’ ICT perceptions and their experience of the training. The key findings revealed that the participants had a significant interest in learning about ICT even though they perceived the area to be difficult and local training opportunities to build their knowledge and skills were insufficient. Further, the girls portrayed high levels of self-efficacy, since they were interested in the program modules that they perceived to be most challenging. These findings suggest that the teaching model may address negative ICT perceptions when teaching females at the Grade 7 to 9 levels. As such, the MST-tree model has the potential to inform the design and execution of similar training programs and interventions.",10.1109/CSCI51800.2020.00174,IEEE,5.0,IEEE,BBC micro:bit;female secondary school students;ICT curriculum;MST-tree model;Scratch,IEEE Conferences,Brazil,Nature Communications
A computational model for visual conceptual blends,P. Karimi; M. L. Maher; K. Grace; N. Davis,2019,"Computational creative systems have the potential to augment the creative design process, particularly in co-creative contexts. We present a computational model for generating visual conceptual blends in the domain of sketching. Our system is motivated by the desire to encourage curiosity, facilitate creative ideation, and overcome design fixation. We start with a model for “conceptual shift”: when a sketch recognized as belonging to one category is visually similar to a sketch from a semantically distinct category. Identifying a potential conceptual shift enables visual analogy and/or conceptual blending. The intent is that these conceptually shifted or blended sketches could be presented to designers to encourage analogical reasoning and creative outcomes. We define and demonstrate our model for the conceptual shift task and alternative approaches for enabling conceptual blends. We describe future plans for evaluation in co-creative contexts.",10.1147/JRD.2018.2881736,IBM,3.0,IEEE,,IBM Journals,France,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
Grammar Instruction with UML,M. Rottenhofer; T. Rankin; B. Sabitzer,2020,"Innovative Practice Work in Progress Paper. Grammar is often taught explicitly in the course of foreign language instruction despite potential misgivings about the details of effectiveness. Different approaches rest on different conceptual and pedagogical rationales, which in turn rely on different forms of conceptual and empirical research. We seek to extend a COOL Informatics approach to grammar instruction in foreign language teaching. COOL Informatics is the acronym for Cooperative and Computer Science supported Open Learning and adopts a neurodidactic approach to teaching in general, in which processes of deduction and generalisation are supported by computational methods of storing, representing and explaining points of language usage. In addition, this represents an opportunity for cross-curricular cooperation between teaching in computer science and language. From neurodidactics we know that the learning and memorizing process in the brain can be supported by using advance organizers such as concept maps for visualizing and structuring the learning contents. With the visual language UML, the Unified Modeling Language, and other diagram types, the field of computer science offers a wide range of such advance organizers. They can be applied for quite a lot of purposes or learning and teaching situations. In this paper we focus on the benefits of computer science models for grammar instruction in foreign language classes aiming at making grammar visible, comprehensible and memorable. We present several ideas for the use of UML diagrams for describing, explaining and learning grammar rules and structures in lucid diagrams. Especially activity and class diagrams or entity-relationship diagrams seem to be very helpful as our experiences gained so far suggest. The paper describes the COOL Informatics teaching approach and it draws a connection between computer science and foreign languages. Furthermore, it shows how to use different types of UML diagrams for visualizing different aspects of grammar teaching and learning. We summarize the most important experiences and results from our last projects related to modeling and present the newest study on UML for grammar learning with some preliminary results.",10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274063,IEEE,2.0,IEEE,modeling;UML;grammar instruction;computational thinking,IEEE Conferences,Canada,Journal of Machine Learning Research

"Computational Thinking, a Discipline to Enhance Digital Skills Such as Programming",Y. Caballero-Gonzalez,2022,"This document presents the results of the development of a learning program on computational thinking through programming challenges with robots oriented to early childhood. The methodological approach used was quantitative, using a quasi-experimental design, taking pretest/posttest measures, with experimental and control groups. The sample of participating students was 46. They belonged to a group of first grade of primary education, aged between 6 and 7 years, in a Spanish educational center. The learning of computational thinking was measured through the following dimensions: algorithmic thinking-sequences, abstraction-patterns and debugging. The learning activities used were an adaptation of the activities proposed in the “TangibleK” robotics curriculum. The results generated show positive effects in relation to the level of achievement reached by the students in the proposed challenges; in other words, there is a significant effect on the mastery of skills related to computational thinking. Differences were found between the pretest and posttest measures of the experimental group. Those of the latter group were statistically significant and higher than those of the control group. Therefore, we can statistically attribute the mastery of computational thinking skills to the participation in the training activities.",10.1109/IESTEC54539.2022.00061,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,learning;teaching;education;information;society;computing,IEEE Conferences,Chile,Journal of Machine Learning Research
Goal-based denial and wishful thinking,C. F. Pimentel; M. R. Cravo,2013,"Denial and wishful thinking are well known affective phenomena that influence human belief processes. Put simply, they consist of tendencies to disbelieve what one would not like to be true, and believe what one would like to be true. We present an approach to an agent's belief dynamics, that simulates denial and wishful thinking, using the agent's goals as the source of affective preference. Our approach also addresses several issues concerning the use of conventional belief revision in human-like autonomous agents. In our approach, every goal produces a wishful thought about its achievement, in the form of a weak belief. Consequently, a “disliked situation” leads to inconsistent beliefs, thus triggering belief revision. Furthermore, the agent's belief set is selected based on a measure of preference that accounts for the “likeability” of beliefs (among other factors). We test an instantiation of our model to assess whether the resulting agent could produce the intended behaviors. The agent produces behaviors of denial and wishful thinking, not only as biases in belief selection, but also as the triggers to hold or reject certain beliefs.",10.1109/MCI.2013.2247831,IEEE,1.0,IEEE,,IEEE Magazines,Spain,Journal of Computer Science

Visual Design Problem-based Learning in a Virtual Environment Improves Computational Thinking and Programming Knowledge,A. Banic; R. Gamboa,2019,"In this paper, we present our design of a high school summer course which uses our Visual Design Problem-based Learning Pedagogy using Virtual Environments as a strategy to teach computer science. Students solved visual design problems by creating 3D sculptures in an online virtual environment. These creations were further explored and refined in immersive display systems fostering embodied learning and remote peer presence and support. To achieve the desired design, students use programming and computing concepts, such as loops, to solve those visual design centered problems, i.e. solving for composition, positive/negative space, balance, as opposed to computational problems first, i.e. create a loop, a fractal, randomized lines, etc. We present results from a study conducted on three high school summer courses. We compared the use of our Visual Design Problem-based teaching strategy (students wrote code to solve challenges based on art and design principles) to a traditional strategy (students wrote code to demonstrate comprehension of computer science concepts). Our results showed that test scores were higher for students in our Visual Design Problem-based courses.

Mapping New Informal Settlements Using Machine Learning and Time Series Satellite Images: An Application in the Venezuelan Migration Crisis,I. Tingzon; N. Dejito; R. A. Flores; R. De Guzman; L. Carvajal; K. Z. Erazo; I. E. Contreras Cala; J. Villaveces; D. Rubio; R.

Non-government organizations and local government units are faced with having to identify, assess, and monitor rapidly growing migrant communities in order to provide urgent humanitarian aid. However, with many of these displaced populations living in informal settlements areas across the country, locating migrant settlements over large territories can be a major challenge. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach for rapidly and cost-effectively locating new and emerging informal settlements using machine learning and publicly accessible Sentinel-2 time series satellite imagery. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in identifying potential Venezuelan migrant settlements that have emerged between 2015 and 2020 in Colombia.

On abstract intelligence and brain informatics: Mapping the cognitive functions onto the neural architectures,Y. Wang,2012,"Summary form only given. A fundamental challenge for almost all scientific disciplines is to explain how natural intelligence is generated by physiological organs and what the logical model of the brain is beyond its neural architectures. According to cognitive informatics and abstract intelligence, the exploration of the brain is a complicated recursive problem where contemporary denotational mathematics is needed to efficiently deal with it. Cognitive psychology and medical science are used to explain that the brain works in a certain way based on empirical observations of corresponding activities in usually overlapped brain areas. However, the lack of precise models and rigorous causality in brain studies has dissatisfied the formal expectations of researchers in computational science and mathematics, because a computer, the logical counterpart of the brain, might not be explained in such a vigor and empirical approach without the support of a formal model and a rigorous means. In order to formally explain the architectures and functions of the brain, as well as their intricate relations and interactions, systematic models of the brain are sought for revealing the principles and mechanisms of the brain at the neural, physiological, cognitive, and logical (abstract) levels. Cognitive and brain informatics investigate into the brain via not only inductive syntheses through these four cognitive levels from the bottom up in order to form theories based on empirical observations, but also deductive analyses from the top down in order to explain various functional and behavioral instances according to the abstract intelligence theory. This keynote lecture presents systematic models of the brain from the facets of cognitive informatics, abstract intelligence, brain Informatics, neuroinformatics and cognitive psychology. A logical model of the brain is introduced that maps the cognitive functions of the brain onto its neural and physiological architectures. This work leads to a coherent abstract intelligence theory based on both denotational mathematical models and cognitive psychology observations, which rigorously explains the underpinning principles and mechanisms of the brain. On the basis of the abstract intelligence theories and the logical models of the brain, a comprehensive set of cognitive behaviors as identified in the Layered Reference Model of the Brain (LRMB) such as perception, inference and learning can be rigorously explained and simulated.The logical model of the brain and the abstract intelligence theory of the natural intelligence will enable the development of cognitive computers that perceive, think and learn. The functional and theoretical difference between cognitive computers and classic computers are that the latter are data processors based on Boolean algebra and its logical counterparts; while the former are knowledge processors based on contemporary denotational mathematics. A wide range of applications of the cognitive computers have been developing in ICIC and my laboratory such as , inter alia, cognitive robots, cognitive learning engines, cognitive Internet, cognitive agents, cognitive search engines, cognitive translators, cognitive control systems, and cognitive automobiles.",10.1109/ICCI-CC.2012.6311158,IEEE,7.0,IEEE,Cognitive informatics;cognitive computing;abstract intelligence;denotational mathematics;cognitive computers;knowledge processors;inference engines;learning engines;perception engines;computational intelligence;applications,IEEE Conferences,France,Science Advances

"A Computational Model of Coping and Decision Making in High-Stress, Uncertain Situations: An Application to Hurricane Evacuation Decisions",N. Yongsatianchot; S. Marsella,2023,"People often encounter highly stressful, emotion-evoking situations. Modeling and predicting people's behavior in such situations, how they cope, is a critical research topic. To that end, we propose a computational model of coping that casts Lazarus's theory of coping into a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework. This includes an appraisal process that models the factors leading to stress by assessing a person's relation to the environment and a coping process that models how people seek to reduce stress by directly altering the environment or changing one's beliefs and goals. We evaluated the model's assumptions in the context of a high-stress situation, hurricanes. We collected questionnaire data from major U.S. hurricanes in 2018 to evaluate the model's features for appraisal calculation. We also conducted a series of controlled experiments simulating a hurricane experience to investigate how people change their beliefs and goals to cope with the situation. The results support the model's assumptions showing that the proposed features are significantly associated with the evacuation decisions and people change their beliefs and goals to cope with the situation.",10.1109/TAFFC.2022.3173812,IEEE,2.0,IEEE,Computational model;stress;hurricane;coping;appraisal,IEEE Journals,UK,Science Advances
An Elaboration of Research Led Computer Science Framework for Early Education,N. A. M. Alharbi; Q. I. Cutts,2023,"Teachers face challenges in teaching new subjects at the early primary level. The difficulties vary from subject to subject. Teachers' first challenge in Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking teaching is their technological literacy and competency challenges. Lack of confidence, time, and willingness are significant reasons for the challenge. One of the studies on mathematics teaching shows that teachers need more knowledge tools and models to facilitate the analysis during the teaching process. Researchers assert that educational practice has focused more on technology than on new pedagogies needed to truly use technology in a transformative way. Frameworks are designed to meet high-level objectives set by the authorities. Teachers are provided with teaching materials for developing the course contents. The frameworks act as a connection between high-level objectives and low-level teaching materials. In this paper, we present the elaboration of a framework for teaching CS at the early stages of education. The framework consists of three components based on modelling real-world problems into a machine-world context and then realising the machine solution in the real world. Moreover, the problem-solving component of the framework emphasizes the iterative process of learning that strengthens the previous concepts and provides a logical con-nection between the previous and new concepts. The framework was evaluated in the context of Saudi Arabia, where the teachers were interviewed individually and then provided with a guide for teaching grade-4 learners. The guide was developed using the material provided by the Saudi Ministry of Education. The teachers taught using this guide over a sequence of lessons. At the end of this time, a second individual teacher interview was conducted to determine teacher experience. The results show that teaching using the framework is effective, and it is not only easier for teachers to understand the teaching method but also for learners to learn the content quickly.",10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10342646,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,K-12;Computer Science Education;Computational Thinking,IEEE Conferences,UK,Journal of Machine Learning Research

Dynamic Cooperative Coevolution for Large Scale Optimization,X. -Y. Zhang; Y. -J. Gong; Y. Lin; J. Zhang; S. Kwong; J. Zhang,2019,"The cooperative coevolution (CC) framework achieves a promising performance in solving large scale global optimization problems. The framework encounters difficulties on nonseparable problems, where variables interact with each other. Using the static grouping methods, variables will be theoretically grouped into one big subcomponent, whereas the random grouping strategy endures low efficiency. In this paper, a dynamic CC framework is proposed to tackle the challenge. The proposed framework works in a computationally efficient manner, in which the computational resources are allocated to a series of elitist subcomponents consisting of superior variables. First, a novel estimation method is proposed to evaluate the contribution of variables using the historical information of the best overall fitness. Based on the contribution and the interaction information, a dynamic grouping strategy is conducted to construct the dynamic subcomponent that evolves in the next evolutionary period. The constructed subcomponents are different from each other, and therefore the required parameters to control the optimization of each subcomponent vary a lot in each evolutionary period. A stage-by-stage parameter adaptation strategy is proposed to adapt the optimizer to the dynamic optimization environment. Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework achieves competitive results compared with the state-of-the-art CC frameworks.",10.1109/TEVC.2019.2895860,IEEE,37.0,IEEE,Cooperative coevolution (CC);dynamic grouping (DyG) strategy;large scale global optimization (LSGO);nonseparable problems,IEEE Journals,Japan,Journal of Machine Learning Research
Wishful Thinking and IT Threat Avoidance: An Extension to the Technology Threat Avoidance Theory,D. Q. Chen; H. Liang,2019,"In this research, we report the empirical findings of a vignette study designed to examine how volitional computer users cope with information technology (IT) threats based on the technology threat avoidance theory (TTAT). We incorporate the construct of wishful thinking, an important form of emotion-focused coping behavior that is rarely studied, along with problem-focused coping into a research model to examine the interaction between the two coping approaches. The results reveal that wishful thinking weakens the effect of perceived avoidability on avoidance motivation. In turn, wishful thinking is positively affected by perceived threat and this effect is stronger when a user has low risk tolerance. Although perceived avoidability can reduce wishful thinking, its effect is fully mediated by perceived threat. This study highlights the important role of wishful thinking in affecting users' security behavior. It not only corroborates, but also extends the extant propositions of TTAT, thus making a significant contribution to IT security research and practice.",10.1109/TEM.2018.2835461,IEEE,19.0,IEEE,Emotion-focused coping;information technology (IT) security;problem-focused coping;technology threat avoidance theory (TTAT);threat;vignette study,IEEE Journals,Japan,Journal of Machine Learning Research
Holonic systems as software paradigms for industrial automation and environmental monitoring,M. Calabrese; V. Piuri; V. Di Lecce,2011,"Holon is a powerful metaphor which captures the recursive structure of biological systems and the organization of their decision processes arranged at various granularity abstraction levels. From a computational intelligence perspective, a holon can be conceived as a goal-oriented community of lower-level holons led by more specific targets. Sub-holons co-operate on sub-problems that represent the source problem at a lower knowledge abstraction level. Such a (recursive) hierarchical organization constitutes the so-called holarchy. Holonic thinking is hence particularly suited for complex and intelligent systems modeling: in particular, its success has been proved in the field of Intelligent Manufacturing. Nevertheless, albeit hierarchical and granular thinking are two fundamental prerequisites in Software Engineering, the use of holonic thinking as software paradigm is still flawing in the literature at the moment. In this regard, the paper introduces the concept of ‘holonic granule’ as a novel software building-block for modeling complex granular systems. Prospective applications of holonic granule-based software models are then commented with particular emphasis to industrial automation and environmental monitoring settings.",10.1109/IA.2011.5953620,IEEE,6.0,IEEE,holon;granular computing;holonic granule;knowledge representation,IEEE Conferences,Spain,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
Human based genetic algorithm,A. Kosorukoff,2001,"A new class of genetic algorithms (GA) is presented. It is based on the idea of outsourcing, a popular trend in business. In a human based genetic algorithm (HBGA), all primary genetic operators are outsourced, i.e. delegated to external human agents. A totally outsourced genetic algorithm uses both human evaluation and the human ability of innovation. It is a multi-agent environment and the mediator of communication between multiple heterogenous agents. The advantage of this approach is its ability to address complex problems for which it is hard, not only to evaluate individuals, but to find a good representation for them. These qualities allow HBGA to process flows of information without knowledge of its particular structure and representation. The suggested conceptual approach can also be used as a general model and a way of thinking about different kinds of genetic algorithms.",10.1109/ICSMC.2001.972056,IEEE,54.0,IEEE,,IEEE Conferences,Mexico,Science Advances
Designing Evaluation Criteria for Disciplinary Competencies: A Case Study of Computer Science,P. Perez-Murueta; L. H. González-Guerra,2024,"The kind of students that currently arrive in the classroom in this technological age require a learning model that promotes their motivation for learning and thus boosts their creative thinking skills to develop disciplinary and cross-cutting competencies in their courses. It is of utmost importance to provide the students with comprehensive training and improve their competitiveness in their professional field by enhancing the skills of future generations to develop both the transversal and disciplinary competencies required that will allow them to become professionals who face challenges and opportunities in their future lives. Disciplinary competencies are the minimum necessary set of knowledge, skills, and attitudes in their disciplinary field for students to perform successfully in different contexts. Traditionally, the evaluation of knowledge is used to evaluate the student's competencies in a course, and it does not usually reflect the degree of achievement of the student's competencies since these evaluations are based on specific topics and not on the acquisition of the competencies that the course should generate. The objective of this study is to design the evaluation criteria for the disciplinary competencies of Computer Science in students, as well as to measure their impact concerning the different subjects of their academic plan.",10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578906,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,disciplinary competencies;criteria evaluation higher education;educational innovation,IEEE Conferences,Spain,Nature Communications
Discovering Programming Talent and Improving Learning Motivation with CodeCombat in K-12 Education,W. C. Choi; I. C. Choi,2024,"Nurturing programming talent early is crucial in today's digital world, especially in K-12 education, underscored by the rise of programming competitions for younger students. However, with limited research in programming talent search, discovering programming talent in primary schools posed a significant challenge. Traditionally, various test-based talent search tools have been utilized for programming talent identification, including the Computer Talent Search Test (CTST) and the Beginners Computational Thinking Test (BCTt). Game-based platforms like CodeCombat offer an engaging alternative to overcome this challenge. CodeCombat integrates game-based learning with programming education, allowing students to apply their computational thinking skills in an enjoyable context for learning Python. The study revealed a significant correlation between CodeCombat, CTST, and BCTt outcomes. This highlighted that CodeCombat emerged as a valuable platform for talent search, aligning seamlessly with the objectives of the test-based tools and suggesting its effectiveness in boosting programming learning motivation in primary school.",10.1109/EDUNINE60625.2024.10500458,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,CodeCombat;K-12 programming education;Programming talent search;Learning motivation,IEEE Conferences,Brazil,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
A computational model of team assembly in emerging scientific fields,A. Lungeanu; S. Sullivan; U. Wilensky; N. S. Contractor,2015,"This paper examines the assembly of interdisciplinary teams in emerging scientific fields. We develop and validate a hybrid systems dynamics and agent-based computational model using data over a 15 year period from the assembly of teams in the emerging scientific field of Oncofertility. We found that, when a new field emerges, team assembly is influenced by the reputation and seniority of the researchers, prior collaborators, prior collaborators' collaborators, and the prior popularity of an individual as a collaborator by all others. We also found that individuals are more likely to assemble into an Oncofertility team when there is a modicum of overlap across its global ecosystem of teams; the ecosystem is defined as the collection of teams that share members with other teams that share members with the Oncofertility team.",10.1109/WSC.2015.7408559,IEEE,2.0,IEEE,,IEEE Conferences,India,Journal of Machine Learning Research
Possible connecting areas of education and intelligent systems,R. Ősz; J. Fodor,2013,"As more and more developed ICT devices appear more and more frequently, these become natural attributes of life for the contemporary “digital generation”. For the generation which grew up in the e-world, it was natural that their everyday activities were tied to the possibilities offered by the networks. These challenges could not leave the pedagogical science cold either. It tried to comply with the generation challenges from the very beginning. It tried to “borrow” those technical devices, theories and methods, which were already applied successfully by other fields of science, adjusting its own learning methods, teaching and learning models and learning environments to them. In our article, we try to draw a parallel between the system of engineering and pedagogy.

Two types of anticipation in sensory-motor coupling,Y. Miyake; Y. Onishi; E. Popper,2003,"The anticipatory timing control in sensory-motor coupling is indispensable to generate coordinative movement among humans, however its cognitive mechanism still remains obscure. In this study we used synchronization tapping task as a model system, and negative asynchrony phenomenon where the tap onset precedes the stimulus onset was analyzed as an example of the anticipation. Especially, applying dual task method, the relationship between the anticipation mechanism and the higher brain function such as attention and working memory was investigated. The results revealed two types of anticipatory timing control. In the inter stimulus-onset interval (ISI) range of 450 to 1800 ms, automatic anticipation that is not affected by attentional resources was observed and was based on feed forward dynamics. In the 2400 to 3600 ms range, the anticipation showed trade-off relationship in the allocation of attentional resources. Magnitude of synchronization error (SE) between tap onset and stimulus onset in this region was scaled by the ISI and the feed back dynamics concerning ISI was suggested. Accordingly, anticipation in timing control was shown to be a dual processing between the attentional process and the embodied automatic process.",,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,,IEEE Conferences,Canada,Journal of Machine Learning Research
No patterns in pattern recognition: A systematic literature review,A. Dasgupta; S. Purzer,2016,"Pattern recognition is one of the fundamental competencies associated with computational thinking and STEM education. Although much has been written to define computational thinking (CT), we argue that CT is a multi-faceted construct and specific aspects of CT (such as pattern recognition) should be examined. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review of literature on pattern recognition to define pattern recognition as an aspect of computational thinking. The synthesis included the Engineering Village database (Compendex and INSPEC). We searched peer reviewed articles and the keywords, pattern recognition, pattern generalization and education. The initial search resulted in 208 articles. The screening of abstracts more closely resulted in 17 relevant articles, which were then read in detail by two researchers. The review of this pool resulted in two relevant articles, one with a focus on mathematics education and the other one in the context of medical education. Surprisingly there were no articles that examined pattern recognition as part of engineering or computer education.

Making Figures for Class Materials Using KETpic Based on Symbolic Thinking,S. Yamashita; S. Takato,2011,"Many mathematics teachers produce original course materials with figures because their use enables students to comprehend mathematical objects. This paper presents a model for producing effective figures for use in course materials. LaTeX is often used to edit course materials and they often use computer algebra system (CAS) to insert graphical image files into the materials. We developed KETpic as a plug-in based on CAS to insert precise and expressive figures into a LaTeX document. After KETpic generates LaTeX-readable codes, the resultant figure is a monochrome, high-quality line drawing. Consequently, teachers can easily improve the quality of their materials. When they produce a figure using KETpic, they can perform mathematical operations as they consider combinations of KETpic commands as mathematical symbols. We designate this mathematical activity as symbolic thinking. By performing symbolic thinking, they need not be overly concerned about writing a program for CAS. Instead, they can concentrate on consideration of more important matters of cognition such as producing an effective figure. They require an advantageous environment in which they can easily perform symbolic thinking. This paper presents two sufficient conditions for this environment: (i) they produce new KETpic commands as the modularization of mathematical operations that they frequently use, and (ii) they create an original package of new KETpic commands. In this paper, we present some examples for these propositions using KETpic based on Scilab.",10.1109/ICCSA.2011.48,IEEE,1.0,IEEE,CAS;KETpic;metacognition;symbolic thinking;modularization of mathematical operations;Scilab,IEEE Conferences,Italy,Journal of Computer Science

The Logic of Cognitive Genetic Structures,R. A. Fiorini,2018,"In this paper we show that, when dealing with genetic structures of cognition, Piaget's approach is the most convenient algebraic form of logic structure to use and which classical logic can be derived from. But the formal rationality provided by the derived “semantic squares” is not spontaneous at rational level, and therefore, should not be easy to learn for adults. This is the main reason why we need reliable and effective training tools to achieve full logic and predicative proficiency, like the Elementary Pragmatic Model (EPM). We present the basic considerations towards the development of computational, intelligent tutoring system (ITS), taking in focus the computational model for current reasoning fallacies based on Piaget-Klein Fourgroup and related EPM training tool to achieve predicative proficiency.

A parallel scalable approach to short-range molecular dynamics on the CM-5,R. Giles; P. Tamayo,1992,"Presents a scalable algorithm for short-range molecular dynamics which minimizes interprocessor communications at the expense of a modest computational redundancy. The method combines Verlet neighbor lists with coarse-grained cells. Each processing node is associated with a cubic volume of space and the particles it owns are those initially contained in the volume. Data structures for 'own' and 'visitor' particle coordinates are maintained in each node. Visitors are particles owned by one of the 26 neighboring cells but lying within an interaction range of a face. The Verlet neighbor list includes pointers to own-own and own-visitor interactions. To communicate, each of the 26 neighbor cells sends a corresponding block of particle coordinates using message-passing cells. The algorithms has the numerical properties of the standard serial Verlet method and is efficient for hundreds to thousands of particles per node allowing the simulation of large systems with millions of particles. Preliminary results on the new CM-5 supercomputer are described.<>",10.1109/SHPCC.1992.232636,IEEE,4.0,IEEE,,IEEE Conferences,China,Nature Communications

Does it matter how well I know what you’re thinking? Opponent Modelling in an RTS game,J. Goodman; S. Lucas,2020,"Opponent Modelling tries to predict the future actions of opponents, and is required to perform well in multiplayer games. There is a deep literature on learning an opponent model, but much less on how accurate such models must be to be useful. We investigate the sensitivity of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a Rolling Horizon Evolutionary Algorithm (RHEA) to the accuracy of their modelling of the opponent in a simple Real-Time Strategy game. We find that in this domain RHEA is much more sensitive to the accuracy of an opponent model than MCTS. MCTS generally does better even with an inaccurate model, while this will degrade RHEA's performance. We show that faced with an unknown opponent and a low computational budget it is better not to use any explicit model with RHEA, and to model the opponent's actions within the tree as part of the MCTS algorithm.",10.1109/CEC48606.2020.9185512,IEEE,4.0,IEEE,Opponent Modelling;Real-Time Strategy;Statistical Forward Planning;Evolutionary Algorithms;Monte Carlo Tree Search,IEEE Conferences,India,Journal of Machine Learning Research
Computational Models of Human Decision-Making with Application to the Internet of Everything,S. Maghsudi; M. Davy,2021,"The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) first appeared a few decades ago. Today, by the ubiquitous wireless connectivity, the boost of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and the advances in big data analytics, it is safe to say that IoT has evolved to a new concept called the Internet of Everything (IoE) or the Internet of All. IoE has four pillars, things, human, data, and processes, which render it as an inhomogeneous large-scale network. A crucial challenge of such a network is to develop management, analysis, and optimization policies that besides utility-maximizer machines, also take irrational humans into account. We discuss several networking applications in which appropriate modeling of human decision-making is vital. We then provide a brief review of computational models of human decision-making.

A Computational Model of Focused Attention Meditation and Its Transfer to a Sustained Attention Task,A. J. Moye; M. K. van Vugt,2021,"Meditation has been shown to aid with the management of affective disorders through improving emotion regulation. Here we begin to develop a theory of meditation by creating a computational cognitive model of focused attention meditation. Our model was created within Prims, a derivative of the ACT-R cognitive architecture. We implemented a model based on an extensive literature review of how the meditation experience unfolds over time. We then tested the Prims model in a sustained attention task, intending to capture a faculty that may be trained with meditation practice. The model was significantly better able to maintain focus after the meditation practice than before. These results agree qualitatively with empirical findings of a longitudinal study on the effects of meditation conducted in 2010. The central mechanism for increasing task relevant focus in the model seems to be a feedback loop. The meditation and mind-wandering processes reinforce themselves and weaken the other. However, this reinforcement is more dispersed in the more elaborate mind-wandering process, which causes it to decrease over time. We speculate that observed improvements in emotion regulation observed after meditation arise from the ability to maintain focus, because it allows the practitioner to avoid emotions spiraling out of control.",10.1109/TAFFC.2019.2908172,IEEE,4.0,IEEE,Focused attention meditation;mindfulness;sustained attention;SART;Prims;transfer;emotion regulation,IEEE Journals,Germany,Nature Communications

"A review of models for introducing computational thinking, computer science and computing in K-12 education",F. Heintz; L. Mannila; T. Färnqvist,2016,"Computer science is becoming ever increasingly important to our society. Computer science content has, however, not traditionally been considered a natural part of curricula for primary and secondary education. Computer science has traditionally been primarily a university level discipline and there are no widely accepted general standards for what computer science at K-12 level entails. Also, as the interest in this area is rather new, the amount of research conducted in the field is still limited. In this paper we review how 10 different countries have approached introducing computer science into their K-12 education. The countries are Australia, England, Estonia, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, South Korea, Poland and USA. The studied countries either emphasize digital competencies together with programming or the broader subject of computer science or computing. Computational thinking is rarely mentioned explicitly, but the ideas are often included in some form. The most common model is to make computer science content compulsory in primary school and elective in secondary school. A few countries have made it compulsory in both, while some countries have only introduced it in secondary school.",10.1109/FIE.2016.7757410,IEEE,120.0,IEEE,,IEEE Conferences,Spain,Computers & Education
Reform on college fundamentals of computer course based on mobile computing,X. Liu; H. Xu,2016,"Fundamentals of Computer is a compulsory course of non-majors in many universities of China. In this paper, we explore the reform on this course for two goals. One is to redesign the teaching content: from operation oriented to computational thinking oriented. Computational thinking is one of the most important ability for 21st century and has become the primary goal of computer foundation education. New content covers the basic principles of computer science as well as the fundamental ways of thinking and problem solving with computer. The second goal is to improve teaching methods by leveraging mobile technology. We propose the use of MIT App Inventor, which is a simple tool for creating mobile applications for Android. Students with no prior knowledge of programming can create entertaining and socially useful applications with App Inventor while practicing computational thinking.",10.1109/ICCSE.2016.7581699,IEEE,2.0,IEEE,App Inventor;computational thinking;fundamentals of Computer;mobile computing,IEEE Conferences,Germany,Science Advances

Work in progress — What are you thinking? Over confidence in first year students,B. Hamlin; J. Riehl; A. J. Hamlin; A. Monte,2010,"Michigan Technological University is one of the nation's largest engineering schools (900+ first year students) and houses a large common first year engineering curriculum. The purpose of this curriculum is to introduce many of the fundamental components of engineering. One of these components is the use of modern computational and programming tools to solve engineering problems. This paper continues a long-term study that began in 2007 and focuses on student confidence with the use of computational tools. On the first day of class, students were surveyed on their proficiency with the use of spreadsheets. Students self reported levels of proficiency from expert to no experience. Students were then asked a simple question regarding a spreadsheet cell equation. Over three years only 16% of the students were correct, while 90% self ranked as familiar or better. A gender bias was noted as women under estimated their skills while men overestimated their own abilities. This study contributes to the growing body of knowledge of gender confidence gaps. Additionally, it lays the groundwork for creating an assessment plan to identify the preparedness of incoming students and measure their skill at the end of the course.",10.1109/FIE.2010.5673354,IEEE,2.0,IEEE,assessment;first year;gender confidence,IEEE Conferences,Canada,Nature Communications
The economical simulation problem,Faming Li; R. E. Skelton,2003,"Think of a digital simulation as a computational device for which one must allocate three computational resources for computing: (a) the given inputs, (b) the outputs and (c) each state variable in the dynamics. This paper assigns these computational resources to guarantee a specified bound on response errors. We define the economical simulation problem (ESP) as designing the simulation of a stable linear system and distributing computational resources (wordlength) among the digital devices such that the computational cost (memory) is minimized without violating the required simulation accuracy. This problem is generally not convex because of the scaling constraint. By exploring the special structure of this joint optimization of the choice of the realizations and the computational resources to be applied, and under a scaling assumption, the ESP is converted to a convex problem. Numerical results are given which compare this method with existing approaches.",10.1109/CDC.2003.1272420,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,,IEEE Conferences,USA,PLOS ONE
Employing narratives to trigger interest in computational activities with inner-city girls,S. Erete; N. Pinkard; C. K. Martin; J. Sandherr,2015,"There has been a well-documented and persistent drop in the number of women in computer science and engineering courses [1]. Young peoples' decisions about participation often start early and have been linked to particular experiences [2]. For some young people, these experiences are less than encouraging. In the US, high school computer science courses are overwhelmingly male dominated [3]. Schools serving minority students and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds often struggle to even offer such classes [4]. Even when opportunities exist, many girls and underrepresented populations face barriers such as negative stereotypes and dearth of role models and community [5]. The Digital Youth Divas program was created to address these issues through intentional design. The program is developed to trigger situational interest [6] in girls through a combination of community, project-based instruction, on- and offline learning spaces, and narrative stories. Triggered situational interest is critical as an opening to move on to subsequent phases that are more independent of environmental factors. Understanding potential effective triggers for girls, minorities, and youth from lower socioeconomic backgrounds is critical to engaging such populations in STEM learning. (1) Community: Middle school girls interested in fashion and design are recruited, especially from areas that have traditionally been underserved. Adult mentors who are not engineers, but share cultural connections with the girls and have gone through curriculum and pedagogical training, attend to specific practices of encouraging, helping to troubleshoot, and developing community. (2) Project-based instruction: The program combines principles of fashion, design, and dance with the power and possibilities of electronic circuits and programming to develop interactive e-fashion projects and virtual programmed choreographies. Scaffolded challenges work through stages of design and computational thinking, including paper prototyping, implementation, feedback, and revision. (3) Integrated on and offline learning spaces: Girls work through projects in a shared physical space using supplied materials. An online system, iRemix, is the mechanism for independent work and leveling up. (4) Interactive narrative stories: Narratives can provide context that helps relate abstract concepts to real-world issues [7], increase motivation and positively contribute to girls' science identity [8], and provide focus for design by communicating tasks, specifically when readers can identify with the stories [9]. Compelling stories conveyed in text and multimedia (video, audio, images) is employed to engage middle school girls in activities involving computational thinking. The stories center on a group of middle school girls involved in the Digital Youth Divas program, and combines aspects of contemporary young adult fiction (mystery, social and emotional issues) with content, topics, and project work from the e-textiles and programming curricula. The interactive narratives unfold through the iRemix platform: girls launch narratives and at intervals are prompted to engage in project-based work. The girls solve challenges by submitting work online, and receive and respond to messages from characters. Our early exploratory research suggested that narratives prompted discussions of identity, and contributed to participant interest in the program content and motivation to engage in project work.",10.1109/RESPECT.2015.7296518,IEEE,6.0,IEEE,,IEEE Conferences,UK,Journal of Computer Science

Lean Management Knowledge Survey in Hungary,J. Kosztolányi; Z. Tégla,2024,"The importance of change management is still under-emphasised in lean transformation because many people are not familiar with change management models. This may be an area that needs more attention in the future. The survey shows that there are professionals at all levels, but also where there are gaps. However, it gives hope that in the coming years these gaps will be filled and more effective lean transformations can be led. The main lessons from the survey can help to set priorities for the coming years. Those in the support phase are the least aware of the importance of a blame-free environment, which is a key factor for effective lean transformation. In the application phase, there is a clear lack of awareness of the Kanban system. The lack of knowledge of plant management is also consistent with the experience. This is also due to the fact that the development of lean was not always based on existing knowledge, but was promoted as a new method different from traditional practices.",10.1109/SACI60582.2024.10619857,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,lean strategy;lean transformation;change management;trainer skill,IEEE Conferences,UK,Science Advances

In order to investigate the mismatch problem in region-related concept detection, we introduce three kinds of methods to annotate the datasets, and then conduct experiments on differently annotated training and testing datasets. We find from these experiments that the detection performance is the best when the regions of a region-related concept are well defined and matched during training and testing, or the detection performance will be decreased. Based on these observations, we propose a fusion scheme to combine the results of classifiers trained with datasets which are annotated by different methods.

Comparative study of engineering problem-solving models,A. Tiwari; A. K. Singh; S. K. Pandey; R. Chaturvedi; A. Chatterjee,2010,"Models of the cognitions used by engineering students to solve problems have always been a part of engineering education. Many, such as the engineering mechanics model (select free-body, draw vector diagram, write equilibrium equations, and solve equilibrium equations), have been part of the introduction of students to engineering topics for a long time. More recently, student problem-solving processes are being reexamined with an eye towards a deeper understanding of the student problem-solving process and developing new approaches to student problem-solving that develop engineering insight, conceptual knowledge, critical examination, and reflective thinking skills. Several of the more recent problem-solving models reported in the engineering and science education literature are dissected and compared in this paper. This comparison indicates that the motivation, definition, exploration, planning, execution, checking, and generalization model of Wankat and Oreovicz [1] is general enough to accommodate most of the elements (but, not necessarily all) of the other models. When properly implemented, this model also contributes to the development of the additional thinking skills required of modern engineers.",10.1109/ICCIC.2010.5705740,IEEE,4.0,IEEE,Learning Models;Problem-Solving;Recent Engineering,IEEE Conferences,France,Journal of Computer Science
The sense-think-act paradigm revisited,M. Siegel,2003,"Approximately 25 years have passed since the ""sense-act-think"" paradigm was advanced as the operational definition of a robot, and as a broad roadmap for robotics research. With the appearance of mobile robots that do real work in the real world, ""communicate"" has de facto been added to the list of functionalities that are essential features of robots. In keeping with the theme of the ROSE-2003 Workshop, this paper attempts to articulate and justify a set of intellectual and engineering challenges for 21 st century sensing and perception for robotics. It especially argues for examining the current and re-examining future roles for teleoperation, both as a practical route around the improbability that machine intelligence will equal human intelligence in the foreseeable future, and because it is apparent that sensor improvement is driven in large part by incremental advances in sensor-display design-and-test loops that are in turn driven by human factors governing perception.",10.1109/ROSE.2003.1218700,IEEE,28.0,IEEE,,IEEE Conferences,Canada,PLOS ONE
Grid Load Balancing Scheduling Algorithm Based on Statistics Thinking,B. Lu; H. Zhang,2008,"As Grid technologies evolve quickly on Internet, research related to resource allocation and task scheduling faces new opportunities and challenges. These new technologies, ideas and approaches provide a new environment for researching and developing load balancing-oriented job scheduling system. Aiming at the hierarchical Grid model structure, following statistical thinking, this paper proposed a new task scheduling and resource allocation algorithm, which can not only increase the utilization of resources and system throughput, but also realize the load balancing within Grid systems. This algorithm consists of three main modules, they are load tracking module, job distributing module and load monitoring module. On the basis of having explained the functions of the different functional parts and the relationships between them, the corresponding pseudo-code algorithm are given. The results of simulative experiments show that the algorithm is effective.",10.1109/ICYCS.2008.66,IEEE,7.0,IEEE,Grid computing;resource allocation;task scheduling;load balancing;statistics,IEEE Conferences,Brazil,Computers & Education

In this study, the “AgilePoint NX” program course was established, and computational thinking was introduced into the course to guide students, through the image flow and low-code learning process, to carry out structured thinking and question speculation, and complete task exercises. This aims to teach design students to learn programming and computational thinking through a cloud-based low-code development platform with image processes and interdisciplinary learning processes. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and evaluate the learning effect through classroom learning observation, simple questionnaire survey, imagination scale, and other methods. Finally, the study found that in interdisciplinary programming learning, different factors lead to low learning effects of programming courses for design background students, resulting in different degrees of learning pain points and learning experiences.

Let's think analog,M. A. Breuer,2005,"In the area of testing ICs, once an IC has failed a traditional go/no-go test, it needs to be tested further to determine if it can support error-tolerant operation for one or more high volume customers. This test must be very efficient since many chips will probably fail, and those that pass will be sold at a discount. We have already developed several efficient test procedures to support error-tolerance. One is a built-in self-test methodology that can sort chips into various bins based on their error-rate, just like resistors are sorted into 1%, 5% and 10% bins (Breuer, 2004).

For that purpose, we conducted a biographical study of CS freshmen at university. In total, 217 students (54 female, 163 male) participated on the survey. The qualitative analysis showed that young men and women do have different viewpoints on computer science. While the male students tend to focus on technical aspects like hardware, mathematics, or logical issues, the female students are attracted rather by creativity, communication, or job opportunities. Furthermore, we investigated the differences between several courses of study. While students of core Computer Science are emphasizing technical issues and their personal experience with computers, the students of Games Engineering, Information Systems, or Bioinformatics mainly focus on the application fields and regard CS as a tool. All these differences seem to influence the selection of the major subject of the students.

End-to-End Speech Summarization Using Restricted Self-Attention,R. Sharma; S. Palaskar; A. W. Black; F. Metze,2022,"Speech summarization is typically performed by using a cascade of speech recognition and text summarization models. End-to-end modeling of speech summarization models is challenging due to memory and compute constraints arising from long input audio sequences. Recent work in document summarization has inspired methods to reduce the complexity of self-attentions, which enables transformer models to handle long sequences. In this work, we introduce a single model optimized end-to-end for speech summarization. We apply the restricted self-attention technique from text-based models to speech models to address the memory and compute constraints. We demonstrate that the proposed model learns to directly summarize speech for the How-2 corpus of instructional videos. The proposed end-to-end model outperforms the previously proposed cascaded model by 3 points absolute on ROUGE. Further, we consider the spoken language understanding task of predicting concepts from speech inputs and show that the proposed end-to-end model outperforms the cascade model by 4 points absolute F-1.",10.1109/ICASSP43922.2022.9747320,IEEE,10.0,IEEE,speech summarization;end-to-end;long sequence modeling;concept learning,IEEE Conferences,Spain,PLOS ONE

On the other hand, rapid technological advances presents both challenges and opportunities to the development agenda. Learning is ever-required in this continuously changing environment. In addition, the global nature of the environment today calls for virtual learning because of convenience, time and cost factors. This research seeks to draw measures to promote virtual learning experience. The research is based on a total virtual learning experience of a masters' level information and communication technology for development (ICT4D) 2.0 course comprised of students in South Africa, Myanmar, Finland and Germany at the University of Tampere. The research included how well the virtual environment and pedagogy promoted constructive, collaborative and conversational learning. In addition, how well the learners' needs, such as, active, reflective and intentional learning are incorporated. The research seeks to promote context in terms of assessing the learning environment, that is, students' virtual learning experience, study contents and learning technologies. Context should be embraced to map the learning process that suits the learners and study contents. The results of this study include highlighting pedagogical techniques and technological tools that fit the learners' and study content requirements to foster learning in a virtual environment. For example in this ICT4D 2.0 course, open learning diary, that is, online submission of students' diaries so that all the course's participants could review, was adopted to make learning more collaborative and conversional. Technological tools, such as, wiki and discussion form were also adopted to promote active and reflective learning in virtual environment.

Complexity of Bayesian belief exchange over a network,M. A. Rahimian; A. Jadbabaie; E. Mossel,2017,"Many important real-world decision making problems involve group interactions among individuals with purely informational externalities, such situations arise for example in jury deliberations, expert committees, medical diagnosis, etc. In this paper, we will use the framework of iterated eliminations to model the decision problem as well as the thinking process of a Bayesian agent in a group decision/discussion scenario. We model the purely informational interactions of rational agents in a group, where they receive private information and act based upon that information while also observing other people's beliefs. As the Bayesian agent attempts to infer the true state of the world from her sequence of observations which include her neighbors' beliefs as well as her own private signal, she recursively refines her belief about the signals that other players could have observed and beliefs that they would have hold given the assumption that other players are also rational. We further analyze the computational complexity of the Bayesian belief formation in groups and show that it is MV-hard. We also investigate the factors underlying this computational complexity and show how belief calculations simplify in special network structures or cases with strong inherent symmetries. We finally give insights about the statistical efficiency (optimality) of the beliefs and its relations to computational efficiency.",10.1109/CDC.2017.8264038,IEEE,3.0,IEEE,Rational Choice theory;Computational social choice;Distributed hypothesis testing;Bayesian inference;Computational complexity;Bayesian computations,IEEE Conferences,Japan,ACM Transactions on Graphics
Digital technology teachers' perceptions of computer science: It is not all about programming,E. Prieto-Rodriguez; R.

There is also extensive research about what those perceptions are for teachers, and what strategies can be used to change them. There is, however, very little information about what these perceptions may be in the case of computer science. In fact, computer scientists struggle to agree on a definition of their discipline, and perhaps the only term common term to all existing definitions is that of computational thinking. This paper reports on an investigation into perceptions about computer science occurred during a series of professional development workshops for Australian Digital Technologies teachers. These workshops aimed to promote the computer science discipline by providing skills and resources necessary to teach computer science and computational thinking. The results of our investigation indicate that Digital Technologies teachers in our sample (N=16) had one common misconception about the nature of computer science.

By representing the road network as a property graph, GPTE decomposes the numerous computations involved in non-linear models to vertices and performs traffic estimation via neural network modeling and iterative information propagation. This paper presents our experiences in designing and implementing GPTE on top of the Spark, an emerging cluster computing framework. Extensive experiments are performed with real-world data input from Singapore's transport authority. Experimental results show that GPTE achieves as high as 88 percent accuracy in traffic estimation and up to 8× performance gain in computation efficiency with the optimization techniques applied. Comparison study demonstrates that GPTE outperforms the baseline solutions by 34 percent on accuracy and 46 percent on processing time.",10.1109/TMC.2018.2873642,IEEE,36.0,IEEE,Traffic estimation;graph-parallel processing;non-linear correlation modeling,IEEE Journals,Spain,Journal of Machine Learning Research
Mode-shape interpretation: Re-thinking modal space for recovering deformable shapes,A. Agudo; J. M. M. Montiel; B. Calvo; F. Moreno-Noguer,2016,"This paper describes an on-line approach for estimating non-rigid shape and camera pose from monocular video sequences. We assume an initial estimate of the shape at rest to be given and represented by a triangulated mesh, which is encoded by a matrix of the distances between every pair of vertexes. By applying spectral analysis on this matrix, we are then able to compute a low-dimensional shape basis, that in contrast to standard approaches, has a very direct physical interpretation and requires a much smaller number of modes to span a large variety of deformations, either for inextensible or extensible configurations. Based on this low-rank model, we then sequentially retrieve both camera motion and non-rigid shape in each image, optimizing the model parameters with bundle adjustment over a sliding window of image frames. Since the number of these parameters is small, specially when considering physical priors, our approach may potentially achieve real-time performance. Experimental results on real videos for different scenarios demonstrate remarkable robustness to artifacts such as missing and noisy observations.",10.1109/WACV.2016.7477725,IEEE,12.0,IEEE,,IEEE Conferences,France,Nature Communications
Is GPT a Computational Model of Emotion?,A. N. Tak; J. Gratch,2023,"This paper investigates the emotional reasoning abilities of the GPT family of large language models. We advocate a component perspective on evaluation that decomposes models into different aspects of emotional reasoning (appraisal derivation, affect/intensity derivation, and consequent derivation). We report two studies. A correlational study examines how the model reasons about autobiographical memories. An experimental study systematically varies aspects of situations in ways previously shown to impact emotion intensity and coping tendencies. Results demonstrate, even without prompt engineering, GPT predictions closely match human-provided appraisals and emotion labels, though GPT struggled to predict emotion intensity and coping responses. GPT-4 performed best on the first study but performed poorly on the second (though it yielded the best results following minor prompt engineering). The evaluation raises questions about how to utilize the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses of such models, including dealing with variability in responses. More fundamentally, these studies highlight the benefits of the componential perspective on model evaluation.",10.1109/ACII59096.2023.10388119,IEEE,2.0,IEEE,affective computing;GPT-3.5;GPT-4;large language models;appraisal theory,IEEE Conferences,Argentina,Nature Communications

Synthetic design of a social regressor and its implementation using Knowledge Request-Broker Architecture,H. Khandan; T. Terano,2010,"By thinking of a society as a cognitive system, this paper proposes a theoretical framework for artificial social intelligence. This framework is implemented using Knowledge Request-Broker Architecture, and its applicability is experienced in the field of system identification by letting a society of self-interested agents, with various skills, to identify a system based on given training data. To develop a theory about how social intelligence works, two questions were asked. First, “What was changed in time that made less intelligent societies to become more intelligent?”, and second “what drives individuals to take part in social productiveness?”. The framework reported in this paper is inspired by the answers given to these question through the study of the emergence of human civilizations, and putting it beside computer and knowledge engineering concepts. The experiments with this system show how social ensemble of simple autonomous agents can solve harder problems, while demonstrating the practicality of the proposed framework and its associated API.",10.1109/NABIC.2010.5716278,IEEE,1.0,IEEE,Artificial Social Intelligence;Distributed Intelligent Systems;Multi-agent Systems;Knowledge Request-Broker Architecture;Social Cognition;Social Regression;Anthropology,IEEE Conferences,Italy,Journal of Computer Science
Idea Garden: Situated Support for Problem Solving by End-User Programmers,J. Cao; S. D. Fleming; M. Burnett; C. Scaffidi,2015,"Although there have been many advances in end-user programming environments, recent empirical studies report that programming still remains difficult for end-users. We hypothesize that one reason may be lack of effective support for helping end-user programmers problem-solve their own way around barriers they encounter. Therefore, in this paper, we describe the Idea Garden, a concept designed to help end-user programmers generate new ideas and problem-solve when they run into barriers. The Idea Garden has its roots in Minimalist Learning Theory and problem-solving theories. Our proof-of-concept prototype of the Idea Garden concept in the CoScripter end-user programming environment currently targets three barriers reported in end-user programming literature. It does so using an integrated, just-in-time combination of scaffolding for problem-solving strategies, for design patterns and for programming concepts. Our empirical results showed that this approach helped end-user programmers overcome all three types of barriers that our prototype targeted.",10.1093/iwc/iwu022,OUP,4.0,IEEE,development frameworks and environments;designing software;interactive learning environments;computational thinking;informal learning,OUP Journals,France,Computers & Education
Teaching Computational Reasoning without a Computer,R. Dias; A. Costa; J. Malaquias; M. Camara,2019,"With the growing need for STEM workers in the job market, schools tend to look for extra-curricular activities that promote this type of skills. With activities like The Inventors or Happy Code, schools encourage kids to have a mindset more open towards technology. Despite these efforts, the tools available to teach programming to primary school students are still lacking. Available solutions can be too difficult to understand, overly expensive for school budgets or may require IT infrastructure that is lacking from the majority of public schools. As a result, this paper aims to create a concept that can convey the fundamentals of programming/Logical Thinking in an accessible and fun way, without using a computer. For this purpose we use a micro-controller, Micro: Bit, and a physical, puzzle-like representation of a programming framework, called MakeCode.",10.1109/IECON.2019.8927169,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Programming fundamentals;Logical Thinking;extra-curricular activities;technology mindset;Micro-controller;Puzzle Representation,IEEE Conferences,Australia,Journal of Computer Science
Natural Language Programming with TryPL,J. Keene; H. M. Jamil,2022,"Computational thinking is considered critical for learning to code in K-12 education standards. The logic-first, syntax-later argument has been instrumental in promoting block-based languages such as Snap! and Scratch with limited success. In contrast, we believe that expressing the logic of computational problems in the student’s language is more convenient and natural. In such an environment, learners will experience the least impedance mismatch between their conceptual view and the target code they write. In this paper, a new natural language-based programming system, called TryPL (Try Programming in Logic), is introduced and discussed. We demonstrate that TryPL helps to identify gaps in logic and assists in validating learners’ mental models of abstract algorithms. An argument is also made as to why using a natural language-based programming environment and a learning model to teach computational thinking could be more effective and appealing to K-12 and first-year college students.",10.1109/ICALT55010.2022.00018,IEEE,2.0,IEEE,Natural Language;Computational Thinking;Conceptual Programming;eLearning;Logic First Syntax Later,IEEE Conferences,USA,Journal of Computer Science
Empirical Insights Into Short Story Draft Construction,C. León; P. Gervás; P. Delatorre,2019,"Existing cognitive models of narrative creation provide accounts for story invention that, while useful, are too high level to be directly applied to formal systems like computational models of narrative generation. Inversely, existing automatic story generation systems that try to implement cognitive models can only rely on approximations to the general concepts these models describe. In order to provide insight to fill the gap between these two approaches, we have conducted a study in which human participants would invent and write short stories while reflecting on their thoughts out loud. The sessions and the analysis of the recordings was designed so that we could observe which specific modifications the participants apply to their story drafts, with the intention to inform the process of creating computational systems based on cognitive descriptions of the narrative creation process. After running the experiments, annotating the videos and analysing the output, we have concluded that there are a number of common modifications that humans tend to apply to a newly created draft, and that this information can be used to the development of storytelling systems.",10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2936919,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Narrative construction;draft revision;empirical observation;computational storytelling;cognitive models,IEEE Journals,Argentina,Science Advances

AI is a term used to describe a system that simulates human intellect using computer programming. AI is advancing quickly in many multidisciplinary fields, including ophthalmology, from healthcare to the accurate preventive measures, investigation, and treatment plans of illnesses. Because of the emphasis on imaging in the diagnosis of eye illnesses, optometry and ophthalmology is at the forefront of AI in medical field and medicine.

When Memory Starts to Think [The Art of Storage],T. Coughlin,2019,"Memory and storage are important elements in consumer electronic devices. They retain data for immediate and delayed processing, and they store the results of processing for later retrieval. All consumer devices use some type of volatile and nonvolatile memory along with processing and communication. Memory and processing have been separate operations using distinct devices; however, there are products becoming available that combine processing power in storage devices, and there is work underway to create processing in close association with digital storage (often called computational storage) or even using technologies where processing is in very close association with nonvolatile memories (in-memory computing). Some emerging memory technologies even have characteristics that can mimic the operations of neurons in the brain and are being used for neuromorphic computing.

Assessment of Subjective Creativity Skill Using EEG Induced Capsule Network,S. Ghosh; L. Ghosh; A. Konar; A. K. Nagar,2020,"Problem solving tests associated with convergent thinking are often used to analyze the creative ability of an individual. Such tests consist of problems whose solution can be reached by an analytical or a creative insight based approach. Detection of creative individuals amongst others undertaking such tests is thus quite challenging since a correct response to the presented problem can be reached using two different cognitive styles. The paper attempts to address a solution to this issue using EEG analysis system. The proposed technique intends to classify the two cognitive styles involved in solving convergent problems with the main motivation of selecting creative individuals amongst other examinees. Moreover, the proposed strategy also attempts to highlight the creative ability of every selected creative individual under three levels: low, medium or high. In other words, the present scheme aims to distinguish creative subjects along with their levels of creative ability from the analytical ones.The procurement of EEG signals from the subjects engaged in the problem solving test are fed to a novel attention induced capsule network to categorize the desired class labels after undergoing the pre-processing and feature extraction phases. Performance analysis undertaken confirms the superlative behavior of the proposed classifier over the state-of-the-art techniques. Thus, the proposed scheme can find its applications in the recruitment of creative individuals in various strata of organizations linked with creation and innovation such as advertising, business, engineering and the like.",10.1109/SSCI47803.2020.9308494,IEEE,1.0,IEEE,insight;creativity;EEG;spectrogram;capsule network,IEEE Conferences,Japan,Computers & Education

The term “Computational Thinking” usually refers to problem solving skills related to Computer Science. Yet, there is neither: a consensual definition of what exactly is this term about; nor which skills are involved. Even under these conditions, several studies are conducted regarding this theme around the world, as well as informal activities applied by non-researchers enthusiasts. Thus, a model to reunite both, academic and non-scientific community, around the Computational Thinking is proposed: the Partnership for Advancing Computational Thinking, PACT. On one hand it is an effort to guide convergence in the literature, leading to more standardized definitions and spotting similarities or disagreements between authors. And on the other hand, it is a platform for sharing resources and experiences between the communities, an initiative to bring the model of research with public participation (Citizen Science) to education. An expandable ontology that is able to consider the perspective of multiple authors over the subjects is used to implement the model. Three different author views and resources are instantiated to illustrate the range, expressiveness and operation of the ontology.

Digital Storybook of Young Product Innovators: An E-Learning Approach to Support Creative Thinking for Elementary Science,H. J. Jih; T. -Y. Huang; C. -C. Lin,2011,"No design, no business. Higher test score doesn't represent better global competitiveness. Creativity is central to the competitive capabilities of 21st century citizens and thus creativity education should play crucial role for every grade curricular. However, the development of creative potential requires work and incubation over time. It takes more efforts than standard curricula can afford. What role can e-learning strategy with focus on science and technology have in sparking innovation? Such e-learning strategy can be the digital storybooks which convey science histories or technology innovation stories with domain knowledge, creative and critical thinking, and problem solving--the basic ingredients of creativity and innovation. Learning occurs within a real world of our daily life. The connections between learners' script memory and contextual learning materials have a positive impact on meaningful learning. Therefore, histories of scientific findings as well as technology innovations would benefit science education especially for elementary pupils. However, there are a few story-based learning materials for primary science curricula. This study design and develop a digital storybook based upon true story of Taiwan young inventors.

Do Structured Flowcharts Outperform Pseudocode? Evidence From Eye Movements,M. Andrzejewska; A. Stolińska,2022,"Computational thinking is a key universal competence, often taught using methods specific to computer science. One step towards achieving it is learning to analyse and create algorithms. Researchers have long been trying to establish how the form of representation of algorithms (pseudocode versus flowchart) affects its understanding and have reached varying, sometimes conflicting results. This article presents findings that provide objective new data on this topic. In our experiment, we used two different types of algorithmic tasks with three levels of complexity and a group of 114 research participants with varying programming skills. In addition, we used an eye tracking technique that allowed us to collect detailed information about the subjects’ attention distribution during analysis of algorithms. Our results show that subjects took significantly less time to analyse flowcharts (than they did with pseudocode), made much fewer errors, and had higher confidence in the correctness of their solution. Based on eye tracking data, a reduced number of both re-analyses of the algorithm and input data re-referencing was observed for graphically presented tasks. The difference in favour of flowcharts was revealed (with few exceptions) for all levels of algorithm complexity (simple, medium, complex), while regarding the duration of analysis the advantage of flowcharts increased with the growing complexity of algorithms. For complex algorithms, a significant relationship was observed between algorithm presentation and level of programming skills versus the duration of task solving and confidence level. Our study strongly supports the idea of using graphic representation of algorithms both when learning to code and in acquiring computational thinking skills.",10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3230981,IEEE,3.0,IEEE,Coding;computational thinking;eye tracking;flowchart;pseudocode;solving algorithmic problems,IEEE Journals,Chile,Nature Communications

Exploring the Design and Implementation of a Robotic-Coding Camp in Teacher Education,P. Y. Arslan; F. Kayali,2023,"This study focused on a bachelor- university-level course that aims to design and implement a robotic-coding camp to train pre-service teachers. Seventeen pre-service teachers participated in this study conducted in the Computational Empowerment Lab at the Center of Teacher Education at the University of Vienna. The researchers aimed to identify specific improvement strategies for in-service and pre-service teachers to enhance their pedagogical practices in designing a robotic-coding camp by promoting student critical thinking, computational thinking, and problem-solving competencies. Additionally, the study proposed to identify the relevant features of the camp's design and implementation that can promote practitioners' engagement and address the challenges they face. The course was offered during the summer semester of 2023. For the procedure of the study, pre-service teachers thought about a problem or situation using the phenomena-based learning method and explained the problem using mediating tools, including educational robots, 3D printers, laser-cutting, and creative Lego boxes, among others. At the end of the course, students developed their project, designed a prototype of a robotic-coding camp, and created digital stories as real-world basis problem statements for their project. Students' assignments and group work interactions, including forum discussions in Moodle, reflection papers, and hands-on activities, were used as data sources. Data collected and analyzed by qualitatively. Participatory action research was used as a research method. The results provide guidelines for how to design and implement robotic coding camps and digital stories for teachers who might want to implement a robotic camp in their future careers. In addition, the results suggest improvement strategies for designing robotic coding activities, including four action steps: (1) phenomenon-based problem statement, (2) visualizing the problem as a digital story, (3) finding a pattern in the problem and (4) creating the learning environment and coding.

Knowledge acquisition at human-computer interaction for product definition,L. Horváth; I. J. Rudas,2011,"Knowledge based methodology is one of the primary areas of development in engineering problem solving methods for decades. In the meantime, product definition has been moved into model space. Establishment of the STEP (Standard for the Exchange of Product Model Data, ISO 10303) product model standard and it application at leading industries during 90's facilitated development of model based integrated solutions for product engineering. During the past decade, the new paradigm of product lifecycle management stimulated integrated handling of information for lifecycle of products. Product model has become a medium in communication between end users of engineering systems including humans and controlled equipment. One of the most critical elements in this scenario is communication of knowledge with product modeling processes in order to generate knowledge background of engineering object definition in product model. This paper introduces a method by the authors to extract knowledge background during definition of product objects in the form of initiated affect on product. Human thinking process is modeled by its elements during definition of intent for a change of a product. Evolving steps towards the defined object changes and the served objectives for the defined objects are recorded.

How to Develop CT Skills Using Robotics Projects Combined with Arts - a Pilot Study,K. Miková; Z. Kubincová,2023,"With the introduction of distance learning during the lockdown, teachers faced a number of problems on how to implement the teaching. Educational robotics was particularly negatively affected by this period. In our country, educational robotics is usually taught in informatics classes. However, in many schools, the teaching of informatics during the lockdown was very limited and often focused only on basic digital skills. As a similar situation occurred in several European countries, the idea of supporting teachers in such cases was proposed. Within an international project we are involved in, a methodology is being designed to develop computational thinking in students at all school levels through educational robotics in combination with a school arts subject. The methodology is based on the idea of project-based learning and should use blended learning methods. In this paper, we describe the planning and the course of an educational activity – a project – using the currently developed methodology. The results presented are from its pilot validation with lower-secondary students without previous experience with robotics. The project combined the theme of Greek myths with robotics using LEGO SPIKE Prime. During the validation, we focused primarily on students’ work with basic programming concepts. Our research problem was to validate the quality and potential of the proposed methodology and the computational thinking skills it can develop. The paper concludes with recommendations for further development of the methodology and also for the use of the selected robotic kit with respect to programming in informatics classes.",10.1109/ICETA61311.2023.10343894,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,,IEEE Conferences,Canada,Computers & Education
Mutual Improvement between Teaching Materials and Assessment Tools for K-12 Programming Education,H. Nagumo; Y. Oomori; Y. Takemura,2021,"This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents an approach to improve teaching materials and assessment tools for K-12 programming education together by creating a virtuous cycle. Improving teaching materials for computing education is in line with the conference theme “Creating a convergence in engineering education and workforce development”. In this research, coding sheets are used as a part of the teaching materials, and the assessment tools are used to assess the algorithmic thinking ability of the students. The assumption here is that there is a mutual impact between the improvement of teaching materials and that of assessment tools. This kind of strategy is important, especially in the setting of elementary school education in Japan in which conducting a pilot study is difficult. In Japan, the new curriculum guidelines were fully implemented in April 2020 in elementary schools and in April 2021 in junior high schools respectively. They will be implemented in April 2022 in high schools. Since the announcement of the new curriculum guidelines, the boards of education in the local governments have been preparing for the programming education in the schools. However, there are still remaining problems, including the shortage of trained teachers and the lack of good assessment tools. In order to remedy the shortage of trained teachers, we designed some coding sheets for the teaching materials consisting of block parts, servo motors, DC-motors, LEDs, and sensors. In our assessment tools which are supposed to assess students' Computational Thinking ability, we included only the questions for assessing algorithmic thinking ability, as there is a limited amount of time for the assessment in schools. We have used our teaching materials and our assessment tools in some elementary schools. Based on the results of the teaching activities, we discuss the strategy to improve the teaching materials and the assessment tools together.",10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637257,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,programming education;teaching material;assessment tool;Computational Thinking;elementary school,IEEE Conferences,Australia,ACM Transactions on Graphics

The Tendon Network of the Fingers Performs Anatomical Computation at a Macroscopic Scale,F. J. Valero-Cuevas; J. -W. Yi; D. Brown; R. V. McNamara; C. Paul; H. Lipson,2007,"Current thinking attributes information processing for neuromuscular control exclusively to the nervous system. Our cadaveric experiments and computer simulations show, however, that the tendon network of the fingers performs logic computation to preferentially change torque production capabilities. How this tendon network propagates tension to enable manipulation has been debated since the time of Vesalius and DaVinci and remains an unanswered question. We systematically changed the proportion of tension to the tendons of the extensor digitorum versus the two dorsal interosseous muscles of two cadaver fingers and measured the tension delivered to the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. We find that the distribution of input tensions in the tendon network itself regulates how tensions propagate to the finger joints, acting like the switching function of a logic gate that nonlinearly enables different torque production capabilities. Computer modeling reveals that the deformable structure of the tendon networks is responsible for this phenomenon; and that this switching behavior is an effective evolutionary solution permitting a rich repertoire of finger joint actuation not possible with simpler tendon paths. We conclude that the structural complexity of this tendon network, traditionally oversimplified or ignored, may in fact be critical to understanding brain-body coevolution and neuromuscular control. Moreover, this form of information processing at the macroscopic scale is a new instance of the emerging principle of nonneural ""somatic logic"" found to perform logic computation such as in cellular networks",10.1109/TBME.2006.889200,IEEE,89.0,IEEE,Biomechanical models;complexity;hand;manipulation;model-structure detection;nonlinear systems,IEEE Journals,Japan,Science Advances

A computer-aided system for narrative creation,Y. -T. Chang; S. -C. Chen; T. -Y.

In this study, we put our focus on narrative creation and propose that a Picture-Attributed-Note (PAN) framework can help with writing job. Picture and attributed notes were used to present and record story elements and to stimulate creativity. The attributed notes are presented in texts and characterized through the following six attributes: Character, Location, Object, Situation, Action, and Theme (CLOSAT) were used in this study to categorize the texts. We hope that stimulated through the pictures and attributed notes, users can better utilize creativity for their stories. In this study, we have implemented the PAN framework as a computer-aided system and conducted experiments to find out how one user would utilize the PAN system for story writing. Four participants were invited to create a story, including one without using the PAN system. We used content analysis to analyze the data through four main categories of coding: Conceptual, Operational, Perceptional and Evaluation (COPE), proposed by Chen [1]. The results reveal that the PAN system helps stimulate user's creativity and did not change their main creating process.

Towards Highly Compressed CNN Models for Human Activity Recognition in Wearable Devices,D. Gkountelos; M. Kokhazadeh; C. Bournas; G. Keramidas; V. Kelefouras,2023,"The widespread usage of wearables set the foundations for many new applications that process the wearable sensor data. Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a well-studied application that targets to classify the data captured by multiple wearable sensors into one of a predefined set of activity classes. Earlier approaches in the area relied on Machine Learning (ML) classifiers, while many researchers proposed solutions based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), e.g., using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) or Convolution Neural Network (CNNs). Even though the usage of DNNs for HAR is a widely explored field, the problem of compressing (thus reducing the computational requirements) the resulting DNN models has been disregarded by the research community. This is of paramount importance if we consider that wearables are characterized by scarce memory and computational resources. In this work, we first analyze the impact of the size of the various CNN components (focusing on the convolution and dense layers) to the model validation performance. As a second step, we focus on two CNN models with diverse memory characteristics (the lean and the fat model) and we employ three different compression techniques (Filter-Based Pruning –FBP,– Low Rank Factorization –LRF,– and dynamic range quantization) assuming various compressibility scenarios.",10.23919/SPA59660.2023.10274441,IEEE,1.0,IEEE,,IEEE Conferences,Spain,Journal of Machine Learning Research
Modeling At School – On the Benefits and Skill Development of the Use of Modeling Diagrams at School,J. Moreno-León; C. Chushig; G.

In this paper we present an approach that is based on modeling, a skill that is commonly taught in Computer Science degrees, often in the last years as it is considered a higher-level, complex skill. Modeling includes various thinking processes like abstraction, reduction, structuring, generalization, among others, that are part of computational thinking in particular and problem solving in general, too. Our hypothesis is that using different modeling techniques from computer science (e.g., UML diagrams) in several subjects at school can be a good way to introduce computational thinking. Therefore we have performed a semi-controlled experiment with Ni=558 students (age 8-16) and N2=18 educators that have used modeling in their lessons.

A TDRL Model for the Emotion of Regret,J. Broekens; L. Dai,2019,"To better understand the nature, function and elicitation conditions of emotion it is important to approach studying emotion from a multidisciplinary perspective involving psychology, neuroscience and affective computing. Recently, the TDRL Theory of Emotion has been proposed. It defines emotions as variations of temporal difference assessments in reinforcement learning. In this paper we present new evidence for this theory. We show that regret - a negative emotion that signifies that an alternative action should have been taken given new outcome evidence - is modelled by a particular form of TD error assessment. In our model regret is attributed to each action in the state-action trace of an agent for which - after new reward evidence - an alternative action becomes the best action in that state (the new argmax) after adjusting the action value of the chosen action in that state. Regret intensity is modeled as the difference between this new best action and the adjusted old best action, reflecting the additional amount of return that could have been received should that alternative have been chose. We show in simulation experiments how regret varies depending on the amount of adjustment as well as the adjustment mechanism, i.e. Q-trace, Sarsa-trace, and Monte Carlo (MC) re-evaluation of action values. Our work shows plausible regret attribution to actions, when this model of regret is coupled with MC action value update. This is important evidence that regret can be seen as a particular variation of TD error assessment involving counterfactual thinking.",10.1109/ACII.2019.8925441,IEEE,5.0,IEEE,Emotion;TDRL Emotion Theory;Computational Modelling;Regret,IEEE Conferences,Spain,Journal of Machine Learning Research

The Internet of Materials: A Vision for Computational Materials,G. D. Abowd,2020,"Weiser inspired us by forcing us to think differently about the size and usage patterns of computers. This vision of computational materials is similarly motivated. Indeed, inspiration is critical at this time, because there are so many challenges to overcome and it will take a community to address them. Significant technical challenges and a desire to deliver meaningful value while guarding against violations of greater societal values can only happen if we are fueled by the passion of this vision.",10.1109/MPRV.2020.2982475,IEEE,9.0,IEEE,,IEEE Magazines,Chile,ACM Transactions on Graphics
Performance of distributed apriori algorithms on a computational grid,S. S. Rawat; L. Rajamani,2009,"When large data repositories are coupled with geographic distribution of data, users and systems, it is necessary to combine different technologies for implementing high-performance distributed knowledge discovery systems. On the other hand, computational grid is emerging as a very promising infrastructure for high-performance distributed computing. Grid applications such as astronomy, chemistry, engineering, climate studies, geology, oceanography, ecology, physics, biology, health sciences and computer science often involve large amounts of computing and/or data. For these reasons, we think grids can offer an effective support to the implementation and use of parallel and distributed data mining systems. This paper describes development of parallel and distributed prior algorithm on grid environment. Apriori algorithm along with FP-growth (frequent pattern growth) is implemented on grid network in each grid node, which finds the local support counts and prunes all infrequent item sets. After completing local pruning, each grid node broadcasts messages containing all the remaining frequent patterns to the coordinator. We have compared the output of conventional method of apriori algorithm with FP-tree in both homogenous and heterogeneous environments. Practical datasets are large in nature and taken from the UCI machine repository and are related to adult, mushroom, and letter recognition, are used to measure the system performance. The detailed experiment procedure and result analysis are also discussed in this paper. In future the security issue among different local datasets and the huge communication cost in data migration can be considered.",10.1109/APSCC.2009.5394128,IEEE,1.0,IEEE,Association rules;Data mining;Grid computing;High performance,IEEE Conferences,UK,PLOS ONE
Programming is Fun! A Survey of the STEAM Digital Distribution Platform,J. Arnedo-Moreno; D. García-Solórzano,2020,"In order to engage the player, video games are often based on challenges that must be overcome. What are colloquially known as programming games present these challenges as puzzles where computational thinking and coding skills have a fundamental role in successfully overcoming them, even though they are not serious games and have been designed purely as entertainment products. Indeed, algorithm design and coding is the fun part. This paper presents a survey of all such games up to February 2020 published in the Steam digital distribution platform, categorizing them by content covered according to a basic programming curriculum. This study provides some insights on the nature of this kind of games and allows assessing their adequacy as educational tools, broadening the body of knowledge on available games for teaching computational thinking and coding, beyond serious games.",10.1109/CSEET49119.2020.9206214,IEEE,3.0,IEEE,coding;programming;computational thinking;video games;Steam;edutainment;learning,IEEE Conferences,France,Journal of Computer Science
Formal Concept Analysis of Students’ Solutions on Computational Thinking Game,J. Guniš; L. Šnajder; L. Antoni; P. Eliaš; O. Krídlo; S. Krajči,2024,"Contribution: We present a framework for teachers to investigate the relationships between attributes of students’ solutions in the process of problem solving or computational thinking. We provide visualization and evaluation techniques to find hidden patterns in the students’ solutions which allow teachers to predict the specific behavior of students or to prevent some student mistakes or misconceptions in advance or further pedagogical intervention. Background: Formal concept analysis is a method of unsupervised Machine Learning that applies mathematical lattice theory to organize data based on objects and their shared attributes. Several fuzzy extensions of formal concept analysis have a great potential to visualize and evaluate students’ solutions, to categorize the solutions into overlapping biclusters (formal concepts) or to generate the attribute implications between extracted attributes. Research Question: Does formal concept analysis describe the various solutions and the relationships between the extracted attributes of students’ solutions in the educational and computational thinking game Light-Bot? Methodology: Targeting the evaluation of 64 students’ solutions in the Light-Bot game, we construct the formal contexts of the extracted attributes. We apply formal concept analysis to construct the concept lattices from two binary formal contexts and to generate attribute implications and their fuzzy counterparts to find the dependencies between the extracted attributes. Findings: The results of our paper provide a description of various students’ solutions which are visualized in the concept lattices. 1) Regarding the concept lattice of binary formal contexts, we obtained the characterization of the largest biclusters which includes a description of the largest group of similar solutions. 2) The attribute implications mainly reveal the characterization of similar solutions, e.g., with a higher count of executed commands in solutions. 3) Using fuzzy attribute implications, we obtained the characterization of solutions with unnecessary commands, going out of the game area, or using indirect recursion.",10.1109/TE.2024.3442612,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,Attribute implications;formal concept analysis;light-bot;visualization,IEEE Early Access Articles,Mexico,ACM Transactions on Graphics
Scratch4All Project - Educate for an All-inclusive Digital Society,V. Vasconcelos; R. Almeida; L. Marques; E. Bigotte,2023,"Computational thinking is a fundamental competence for the 21st century. It refers to a set of capacities and skills that can be stimulated to facilitate the teaching-learning process in a wide range of fields, including Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Experts in information technology argue that the earlier children are exposed to programming through digital platforms appropriate for their age, the easier it will be for them to assimilate their concepts in the future. This effort should be continued throughout the educational stages of children and youth to increase students' interest in pursuing STEM studies and careers.This paper describes the Scratch4All project promoted by the consortium CASPAE (a Private Social Solidarity Institution) and Inova-Ria, with technical assistance from professors at the public higher education institution Coimbra Institute of Engineering. Scratch4All Project includes the activities Scratch on Road, Programming and Robotics Lab, and the Scratch4All Digital Platform. According to the impact assessment for the school year 2020-2021, the Scratch4All project promotes school success and true equality in access to new technologies for students in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd cycles of elementary school, developing essential skills for their academic and professional future such as computational thinking, STEM competencies and social skills.

The lessons were intended to support students' computational thinking while learning mathematics. To do so, we used the educational design research (EDR) methodology to develop the lessons. We collaborated with mathematics teachers and practitioners to improve the lessons. We also piloted the lessons for a few junior high school students in Indonesia. We collected data from online discussions with teachers and practitioners, GeoGebra files, and screen video recordings. We found that collaboration with teachers and practitioners helped us to refine the lessons. The pilot study showed the engagement of students in programming and debugging.

"Animal Cognition, Epistemic Fluency, Social Networks and the Scientific Habit of Mind",D. M. Morrison; H. Xiangen,2012,"This concept paper suggests a new way of thinking about the origin, growth, and spread of a general-purpose ""scientific habit of mind"" in humans, and discusses how intelligent coaching agents may help. The argument begins with a description of the role of the cognitive cycle in animal thinking. We then examine critical differences between non-human and human cognition, especially in respect to the crucial and yet problematic role of language and linguistic interaction in the ""widening spread and deepening hold"" of scientific thinking and discourse in human populations. The paper concludes with a vision of a new kind of open, networked learning community inhabited by human learners, human experts, and intelligent agents, and suggests ways of evaluating the development of scientific thinking within these communities using a combination of social network and semantic space analysis.",10.1109/ICMLA.2012.166,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,intelligent tutors;animal cognition;epistemic game theory;social capital,IEEE Conferences,India,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
So you think you can PLS-DA?,D. Ruiz-Perez; H. Guan; P. Madhivanan; K. Mathee; G. Narasimhan,2018,"Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) is a popular machine learning tool that is gaining increasing attention as a useful feature selector and classifier. In an effort to understand its strengths and weaknesses, we performed a series of experiments with synthetic data and compared its performance to its close relative from which it was initially invented, namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We demonstrate that even though PCA ignores the information regarding the class labels of the samples, this unsupervised tool can be remarkably effective as a feature selector. In some cases, it outperforms PLS-DA, which is made aware of the class labels in its input.Our experiments range from looking at the signal-to-noise ratio in the feature selection task, to considering many practical distributions and models encountered when analyzing bioinformatics and clinical data. Other methods were also evaluated.Our work sheds light on the kind of relationships and data models with which PLS-DA can be effective both as a feature selector as well as a classifier. In particular, we claim that when classes are determined by linear or non-linear relationships, PLS-DA provides almost no insight into the data. But it is effective when the classes have a clustered distribution on the signal features, even when these features are hidden among a large number of noise. PLS-DA retains a strong performance even when the classes are contained in n-orthotopes (i.e., rectangular boxes in the subspace of the signal features).Finally, we analyzed an interesting data set from 396 vaginal microbiome samples where the ground truth for the feature selection was available. Again, the results highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of PLS-DA in comparison with PCA.",10.1109/ICCABS.2018.8542038,IEEE,5.0,IEEE,PLS-DA;PCA;Feature Selection;Dimensionality Reduction;Bioinformatics,IEEE Conferences,UK,Science Advances
New Informatics curriculum — Croatian tradition with world trends,L. Kralj,2016,"Croatian curriculum reform started in February 2015 as one of measures in Strategy for education, science and technology.

Changes in Background EEG Activity after Creative Task in Aged Adults,E. Y. Privodnova; N. V. Volf; E. A. Merculova,2019,"Cognitive training is considered as an effective intervention for slowing cognitive decline, however single-domain training programs have shown limited transfer to untrained tasks. Complex cognitive training has a potential to yield broader transfer effect. Given that creative thinking involves variety of cognitive subprocesses, creative tasks may be useful as a complex training paradigm. In line with this assumption, creative engagement has a neuroprotective effect in older subjects, improving mental health and well-being. However, neural mechanisms underlying the effect has remained unknown. Evidence suggests that post-task changes in resting-state brain activity may be detected in regions involved during training. The current study was aimed to reveal changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during creative task performance and to identify whether those activity patterns persist in the baseline EEG after the end of a creative session. EEG was registered in 25 elderly ( 64±6 years) high-functioning subjects before, during and after creative problem solving, consisting of 30 verbal and 30 figural tasks. Current source density estimates and subsequent statistical contracts using statistical non-parametrical mapping (SnPM) were calculated via LORETA package. We found a significant increase of spectral density from pre- to post-task interval in theta-gamma frequency bands. The effect was localized in parieto-occipital cortex, overlapping with the region showing synchronization during the tasks performance. Observed changes in resting-state EEG activity may be considered as an indicator of use-dependent neuroplasticity.",10.1109/SIBIRCON48586.2019.8958329,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,creative thinking;creative training;post-task changes;older adults;EEG,IEEE Conferences,Argentina,Nature Communications
Creativity index calculation with question answering system using BERT model,A. Nandgaonkar; S. B. Mane; V. Khatavkar,2023,"This system proposes a question-answer model to analyze answers given by the users to the open-ended question. For this system, we use a squad dataset. The squad dataset is helpful for open-ended questions. The model uses NLP and the BERT question-answer model for handling the answers. Problem-solving deals with the analysis of questions and answering them in a creative, feasible, and efficient way. The problem-solving the approach gives the way of thinking of the problem solver. Computational methods along with NLP are being developed to calculate these indices. With the help of question-answer systems in NLP, the users’ answers are analyzed and measured are being attempts to perform such analysis but the answers to the questions are varied from person to person which makes answer analysis challenging. Answers given by users and answer for the question present in the squad dataset is compared by using cosine similarity to calculate the creativity index. The creativity index is a linear combination of fluency, flexibility, uniqueness, and elaboration indices; calculated for every given answer by comparing given answers and the stored answers. The system is trained and tested for the general questions present in the squad dataset. This system is beneficial to predict and measure the creative thinking, problem-solving ability, and thinking ability of the user. It helps to build the work culture, societal culture, and behavior of individuals in the institution, community, and workplace. The CI is a tremendously useful tool for businesses, office employees, and students. Thinking and problem-solving skills are calculated using this technique.",10.1109/CONIT59222.2023.10205798,IEEE,0.0,IEEE,NLP (Natural Language Processing);BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model;Cosine similarity;Creative Index (CI);Squad Dataset;Question Answering model,IEEE Conferences,Germany,Computers & Education

Investing during a Fintech revolution: The hedge and safe haven properties of Bitcoin and Ethereum,Nguyen B.K.Q.; Pham D.T.N.,2025,"Global financial markets have witnessed significant transformations in response to the worldwide spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, resulting in heightened risk and alterations in inter-market relationships. Both cryptocurrency markets and conventional equity markets have been influenced by these changes. This study aims to investigate the potential hedging and safe haven benefits of Bitcoin and Ethereum against risks in Asian emerging stock markets under various Covid-19 pandemic contexts including the onset of the pandemic, varying levels of panic, the extent of media attention, and sentiment analysis. Utilizing the dynamic correlation coefficients derived from the DCC-GARCH methodology, our analysis indicates that, both Bitcoin and Ethereum do not effectively serve as hedges or safe havens for major Asian emerging stock markets during the Covid-19 outbreak. These results remain robust during more extreme periods characterized by high panic, intense media attention, and negative sentiment.

Lung Infection Detection via CT Images and Transfer Learning Techniques in Deep Learning,Shames M.A.; Kamil M.Y.,2025,"Healthcare systems are battling the global coronavirus epidemic with limited resources, requiring early diagnosis and enhanced tools for pandemic prevention. The computer can aid in diagnosis via computed tomography images like PCR. Deep learning and machine learning are popular methods, and their main contributions are COVID-19 detection and prediction. This work aimed to develop an AI-based early detection strategy for COVID-19 based on computed tomography images. The model was trained and tested using a dataset that includes CT images. The SARS-COV-2 dataset contains 2482 CT images of 210 patients from publicly available sources. The modified model demonstrated encouraging outcomes by greatly enhancing the sensitivity measure (95.82±1.75), which is an essential criterion for accurately detecting instances of COVID-19 infection. In addition, the model generated higher values for the accuracy metric (91.67±1.68), the specificity (88.08±3.72), the precision metric (87.51±3.27), the F1_score (91.43±1.55), and the area under the curve (91.98±1.55). Deep learning techniques significantly facilitate the early detection of COVID-19. Its use has the potential to improve clinical doctors' readiness and the management of pandemics. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

Nano-engineered paper-based electrochemical biosensors: Versatile diagnostic tools for biomarker detection,Manikandan R.; Jang H.-G.; Kim C.-S.; Yoon J.-H.; Lee J.; Paik H.-J.; Chang S.-C.,2025,"After the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for highly sensitive, miniaturized, non-destructive sensing of disease biomarkers has received significant attention. Nanomaterial-coated paper-based electrochemical biosensors were utilized to diagnose various disease biomarkers. Nanomaterials have contributed significantly to electrochemical biosensors advancements because they improve biosensing properties such as specificity, sensitivity, robustness, and reproducibility. Moreover, the viability of environmentally friendly paper-based electrochemical biosensors for the highly sensitive detection of target analytes in complicated samples has improved. Paper-based electrode (PE) substrates are desirable for lab-scale and large-scale manufacturing applications because they are inexpensive, do not require microfluidic pumps because electrolyte migration can be achieved through capillary action, can be stacked with reagents for reagent-less applications, and can achieve multiphase detection via origami-based approaches. Therefore, this review considers the properties of functional nanomaterials, such as the active surface area available for interactions, attachment of biorecognition species to the electrode via microporous capillary action, cellulose conductivity, and photochemical functional properties, and electrochemical properties of carbon-based conductive pastes that are widely used to print sensors onto paper substrates. The conclusions can be used to improve PE biosensors for biomedical research. Recent paper-based electrodes modified with different nanomaterials for detecting various biomarkers are discussed. © 2024",10.1016/j.ccr.2024.216261,Elsevier B.V.,0.0,Scopus,Biomarker; Conductive paste; Nanomaterial; Paper-based electrode; Photoelectrochemical; Point-of-care device,Review,Chile,Journal of Computer Science
Bilateral posterior ischemic optic neuropathy following COVID-19: a case report and literature review,Mambretti M.; Premoli L.; Lucchini S.; Govetto A.; Carimati F.; Radice P.,2025,"Background: Multiple cases of ischemic optic neuropathy following infection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been documented. The most described entity is anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, although rare cases of posterior ischemic optic neuropathy have been reported, mostly in the setting of severe disease. We present the first report of posterior ischemic optic neuropathy involving both eyes and following uncomplicated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Relevant literature is analyzed and discussed. Case Description: A 65-year-old man presented with severe painless visual loss beginning in the lower hemifield of the right eye and involving both eyes in the span of 24 hours. Visual acuity in the right eye was reduced to no light perception and to uncertain light perception in the left eye. He had recently recovered from COVID-19 which had manifested with mild respiratory symptoms that did not require medical treatment. Complete ophthalmological evaluation revealed no anomalies except for non-reactive pupils. As radiological investigations including contrast magnetic resonance and computer tomography did not reveal acute events bilateral posterior ischemic optic neuropathy was hypothesized. As giant cell arteritis is an important cause of sequential ischemic neuropathy, high dose steroid treatment was carried out until temporal biopsy ruled out vasculitis. Steroid treatment was then slowly tapered over the course of 45 days. The patient had a history of carotid stroke and thrombophilia and blood pressure monitoring after the event revealed hypotensive episodes which led to the suspension of antihypertensive medication. At one-month follow-up, a slight improvement in visual functioning was observed, with the patient being able to count fingers with both eyes. This improvement was confirmed at two months. Fundus examination revealed pale optic discs, which confirmed the diagnosis of posterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Conclusions: COVID-19 can induce vascular occlusion through endothelial dysfunction. Additionally, we propose that lowering of systemic blood pressure, as reported following infection, might also contribute to or even instigate optic nerve ischemia. © AME Medical Journal.",10.21037/amj-23-105,AME Publishing Company,0.0,Scopus,case report; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); ischemic optic neuropathy (ION); posterior ischemic optic neuropathy (PION),Article,France,PLOS ONE
The molecular effects of ozone on human hemoglobin oligomerisation pre- and post-COVID-19 infection accompanied by favoured antioxidant roles of cinnamaldehyde and phenyl ethyl alcohol,Mahlooji M.; Beni R.N.; Mehraban F.; Seyedarabi A.,2025,"Many studies have shown that oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the present work, a case-study was conducted by comparing human hemoglobin (Hb) oligomerization upon autohemotherapy before and after COVID-19 infection. Structural changes of Hb exposed to different concentrations of ozone (40, 60, and 80 μg/ml) in whole blood, before COVID-19 infection, was compared to Hb exposed to the highest concentration of ozone (80 μg/ml) in whole blood, in the presence of two antioxidants, cinnamaldehyde (Cin) and phenyl ethyl alcohol (PEA), after COVID-19 infection. The structural analyses in this study was performed using various techniques, including DPPH radical scavenging assay, intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, UV–VIS absorption spectroscopy, SDS-PAGE, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and molecular docking studies. The results showed that Hb oligomerization by ozone increased significantly after COVID-19 infection. In addition, at an ozone concentration of 80 μg/ml, the affinity of heme groups for globin chains and to oxygen molecules were shown to increase, whereas the stability of Hb decreased. In contrary, the addition of Cin and PEA prevented the adverse effects of ozone with PEA showing more efficacy in maintaining the native structure of Hb. Taken together, these results provided insights into the adverse effects of COVID-19 infection on Hb oligomerization and highlighted the importance of an individual's antioxidant capacity in protecting Hb from ozone, especially high ozone concentrations in autohemotherapy, and further emphasised the importance of personalising the concentration of ozone for patient administration, in order to provide a safe and effective autohemotherapy treatment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.molstruc.2024.140131,Elsevier B.V.,0.0,Scopus,"Antioxidants; Autohemotherapy; Cinnamaldehye; COVID-19; Ozone, Human hemoglobin; Phenyl ethyl alcohol",Article,USA,Journal of Machine Learning Research
Modelling and investigating memory immune responses in infectious disease. Application to influenza a virus and sars-cov-2 reinfections,Massard M.; Saussereau B.; Chirouze C.; Lepiller Q.; Eftimie R.; Perasso A.,2025,"Understanding effector and memory immune responses against influenza A virus (IAV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and re-infections is extremely important, given that they are now endemic in the community. The goal of this study is to investigate the role of memory cells and antibodies in the immune responses against IAV and SARS-CoV-2 re-infections. To this end, we adapt a previously-published within-host mathematical model (Sadria & Layton, 2021) for the primary immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infections, by including two types of memory immune cells, i.e., memory CD8+ T-cells and memory B-cells, and by parametrising the new model with values specific to the two viruses. We first investigate the long-term dynamics of the model by identifying the virus-free steady states and studying the conditions that ensure the stability of these states. Then, we investigate the transient dynamics of this in-host model by simulating different viral reinfection times: 20 days, 60 days and 400 days after the first encounter with the pathogen. This allows us to highlight which memory immune components have the greatest impact on the viral elimination depending on the time of reinfection. Our results suggest that memory immune responses have a greater impact in the case of IAV infections compared to SARS-CoV-2 infections. Moreover, we observe that the immune response after a secondary infection is more efficient when the reinfection occurs at a shorter time. © 2024 The Authors",10.1016/j.idm.2024.09.009,KeAi Communications Co.,0.0,Scopus,Covid-19; Immunology; Influenza a; Memory cells; SARS-CoV-2; Within-host model,Article,China,Science Advances
Utility of plasma nucleocapsid protein in predicting severity and prognosis in severe COVID-19 patients with comorbidities,Wang D.; Shen Y.; Wu J.; Li Y.; Ma K.; Jiang G.; Li X.; Qin H.; Chen K.; Wu Z.; Guan M.,2025,"Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic poses ongoing challenges to global public health systems, emphasizing the critical necessity for efficient diagnostic and prognostic markers. This study evaluates the MAGLUMI® SARS-CoV-2 Ag N protein chemiluminescent immunoassay (MAG-CLIA) for its analytical performance and its role in predicting disease severity and prognosis among severe COVID-19 patients with comorbidities. Methods: Analytical validation of plasma MAG-CLIA SARS-CoV-2 Ag N protein encompassed precision, interference, LoQ and linearity. Plasma N protein concentrations and other biomarkers were measured within 48 h of admission, tracked until discharge or death. The Mann-Whitney U test explored the association between plasma N protein and COVID-19 severity or prognosis. Longitudinal monitoring of plasma N protein dynamics was conducted in representative patients. Results: MAG-CLIA demonstrated precise quantification of plasma N protein with a CV below 10 % and minimal interference. The LoQ was 0.88 ng/L, with a broad linear range. Plasma N protein showed high diagnostic accuracy for COVID-19, achieving 95.42 % specificity and 78.32 % sensitivity at 2.388 ng/L. Plasma N protein emerged as a valuable prognostic indicator, correlating with mechanical ventilation need and patient survival. Plasma N protein concentrations ≥ 424.3 ng/L (AUC 0.8102, sensitivity 78.38 %, specificity 85.48 %) were associated with poor prognosis in severe COVID-19 patients with comorbidities. Conclusions: MAG-CLIA's SARS-CoV-2 N protein detection in plasma demonstrates both analytical reliability and clinical relevance in our inaugural evaluation. As a promising prognostic biomarker for severe COVID-19 patients, it offers crucial insights into disease severity and progression, emphasizing the significance of early monitoring and intervention, especially for patients with comorbidities. © 2024",10.1016/j.cca.2024.119951,Elsevier B.V.,0.0,Scopus,Chemiluminescent immunoassay; Comorbidity; COVID-19 prognosis; Mechanical ventilation; SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein,Article,China,Science Advances
Diosmetin-7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside from Pogostemonis Herba alleviated SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia by reshaping macrophage polarization and limiting viral replication,Xu Y.-L.; Li X.-J.; Cai W.; Yu W.-Y.; Chen J.; Lee Q.; Choi Y.-J.; Wu F.; Lou Y.-J.; Ying H.-Z.; Yu C.-H.; Wu Q.-F.,2025,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: Viral pneumonia is the leading cause of death after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite effective at early stage, long-term treatment with glucocorticoids can lead to a variety of adverse effects and limited benefits. The Chinese traditional herb Pogostemonis Herba is the aerial part of Pogostemon Cablin (Blanco) Benth., which has potent antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. It was used widely for treating various throat and respiratory diseases, including COVID-19, viral infection, cough, allergic asthma, acute lung injury and lung cancer. Aim of the study: To investigate the antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects of chemical compounds from Pogostemonis Herba in SARS-CoV-2-infected hACE2-overexpressing mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells and hACE2 transgenic mice. Materials and methods: The hACE2-overexpressing RAW264.7 cells were exposed with SARS-CoV-2. The cell viability was detected by CCK8 assay and cell apoptotic rate was by flow cytometric assay. The expressions of macrophage M1 phenotype markers (TNF-α and IL-6) and M2 markers (IL-10 and Arg-1) as well as the viral loads were detected by qPCR. The mice were inoculated intranasally with SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant to induce viral pneumonia. The levels of macrophages, neutrophils, and T cells in the lung tissues of infected mice were analyzed by full spectrum flow cytometry. The expressions of key proteins were detected by Western blot assay. Results: Diosmetin-7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (DG) presented the strongest anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Intervention with DG at the concentrations of 0.625–2.5 μM not only reduced the viral replication, cell apoptosis, and the productions of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) in SARS-CoV-2-infected RAW264.7 cells, but also reversed macrophage polarity from M1 to M2 phenotype. Furthermore, treatment with DG (25–100 mg/kg) alleviated acute lung injury, and reduced macrophage infiltration in SARS-COV-2-infected mice. Mechanistically, DG inhibited SARS-COV-2 gene expression and HK3 translation via targeting YTHDF1, resulting in the inactivation of glycolysis-mediated NF-κB pathway. Conclusions: DG exerted the potent antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities. It reduced pneumonia in SARS-COV-2-infected mice via inhibiting the viral replication and accelerating M2 macrophage polarization via targeting YTHDF1, indicating its potential for COVID-19 treatment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.jep.2024.118704,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,0.0,Scopus,Apigenin (pubchem CID: 5280443); Apigenin-7-glucoside (pubchem CID: 5280704); Diosmetin-7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (pubchem CID: 11016019); Glycolysis; HK3; Luteolin (pubchem CID: 5280445); Luteolin-7-glucoside (pubchem CID: 5280637); Macrophage polarization; Ombuin (pubchem CID: 5320287); Quercetin (pubchem CID: 5280343); Remdesivir (pubchem CID: 121304016); Tilianin (pubchem CID: 5321954); Velutin (pubchem CID: 5464381); Viral replication; Vitexin (pubchem CID: 5280441); YTHDF1,Article,India,Computers & Education
"A novel tetrazole–1,8-naphthyridine–amide hybrid: First structurally characterized tetrazolo[1,5-a]-derivative of naphthyridines with a luminescence activity, potency against COVID-19, and anticancer activity",Adhikari S.; Nath S.; Sen T.; Raza R.; Sahin O.; Eftekhari-Sis B.; Mahmoudi G.; Borah P.; Verma A.K.; Safin D.A.,2025,"This contribution is devoted to a novel tetrazole–1,8-naphthyridine–amide hybrid N-(tetrazolo[1,5-a][1,8]naphthyridin-8-yl)butyramide (1), which was produced from N-(7‑chloro-1,8-naphthyridin-2-yl)butyramide by reacting with NaN3. In the crystalline state, molecules of 1 exhibited C–H···O intramolecular bonds and produced a 1D chain through N–H···N and C–H···N contacts. Chains produce a supramolecular 2D layer due to π···π interactions. In the UV–vis spectrum, 1 exhibits bands up to ∼360 nm and is emissive with a broad band from about 335 to 450 nm, with the maximum at 365 nm. Fine features of 1 were revealed using the density functional theory (DFT) calculations in water. The computed geometrical parameters are in accordance with the experimental values. The frontier electronic orbitals were found on the molecule except for the propyl fragment, and 1 was determined as a strong electrophile. The computed absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination and toxicity (ADMET) features predicted positive gastrointestinal absorption (GA) activity and negative human blood-brain barrier (BBB) property of 1. Compound 1 in silico tested to inhibit some of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins. Papain-like protease (PLpro) and Nonstructural protein 3 (Nsp3_range 207–379-MES) were established to interact with 1 more efficiently. The PLpro complex with 1 exhibits a ligand efficiency scores for a Hit.

A novel analysis of interoceptive underpinnings of anxious psychopathology in COVID-19 survivors,D'Orsi G.; Palladini M.; Mazza M.G.; Rovere-Querini P.; Scalabrini A.; Benedetti F.,2025,"Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 affects brain, body, and their interchange. We investigated interoceptive mechanisms in COVID-19 survivors focusing on their potential link with psychopathology and inflammatory biomarkers. Methods: We assessed interoceptive accuracy (IAc) and time-perceiving (TA) skills of 57 COVID-19 survivors one month after hospital discharge through, respectively, a heartbeats perception task and a time duration task. Each participant was assessed about his interoceptive awareness (IAw) through Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness questionnaire (MAIA) and then, screened for post-traumatic (Impact of Events Scale – IES-R), anxious (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory – STAI-Y1) and depressive (Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale - ZSDS; Beck Depression Inventory - BDI-13) symptoms. Biomarkers of inflammation (platelet count, PC; mean platelet volume, MPV and systemic immune-inflammation index, SII) were obtained in a subsample of 40 survivors by a blood sampling conducted at admission and discharge time from the hospital. Correlational, GLM, GLMZ, and mediation analyses were performed. Results: IAc did not correlate with TA confirming the reliability of interoceptive measure. IAc positively predicts MAIA's Trusting subscale and negatively predicts anxious psychopathology which fully mediates the effect of IAc on Trusting.PC at hospital admission predicts anxiety at one month after recovery. Again, a higher decrease of SII during hospitalization predicts higher IAc skill and lower anxiety state at one month. The link between SII change and anxiety is fully mediated by IAc. Conclusions: Our results unveil a potential key role of interoception and brain-body interchange in the exacerbation and maintenance of anxiety psychopathology in COVID-19 survivors. © 2024",10.1016/j.bbr.2024.115275,Elsevier B.V.,0.0,Scopus,Anxiety; COVID-19; Inflammatory biomarkers; Interoceptive accuracy; Interoceptive awareness,Article,Australia,PLOS ONE
The advantages of CBOE credit VIXs for corporate bond investors in North America: A sectoral analysis,Iqbal N.; Bouri E.; Ozkan O.,2025,"This paper examines the safe-haven role of the recently introduced CBOE credit VIXs for investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds, at both aggregate and sectoral levels. Using a time-varying quantile-based framework and daily data from June 5, 2014 to December 10, 2023, the safe-haven role of credit VIX is confirmed irrespective of bond sector. The safe-haven property of credit VIX is pronounced for high-yield bonds which embed a high credit risk-premium. This result stands when taking into account interest rate volatility, as measured by the MOVE index. A time-varying analysis shows the persistence of credit VIX as a safe-haven for all bond sectors after the COVID-19 pandemic and during a high US interest-rate regime. Corporate bond investors and traders can use these findings to refine their investment and trading decisions and offset credit risk during both normal and turbulent periods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.ribaf.2024.102607,Elsevier Ltd,0.0,Scopus,CBOE credit VIX; COVID-19 outbreak; Cross-quantilograms and quantiles; Fed tightening cycle; High-yield sector bonds; Investment-grade sector bonds; Safe-haven,Article,Spain,Journal of Machine Learning Research
Attributes of higher- and lower-performing hospitals in the Consult for Addiction Treatment and Care in Hospitals (CATCH) program implementation: A multiple-case study,Stevens E.R.; Fawole A.; Rostam Abadi Y.; Fernando J.; Appleton N.; King C.; Mazumdar M.; Shelley D.; Barron C.; Bergmann L.; Siddiqui S.; Schatz D.; McNeely J.,2025,"Introduction: Six hospitals within the New York City public hospital system implemented the Consult for Addiction Treatment and Care in Hospitals (CATCH) program, an interprofessional addiction consult service. A stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial tested the effectiveness of CATCH for increasing initiation and engagement in post-discharge medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) treatment among hospital patients with opioid use disorder (OUD). The objective of this study was to identify facility characteristics that were associated with stronger performance of CATCH. Methods: This study used a mixed methods multiple-case study design. The six hospitals in the CATCH evaluation were each assigned a case rating according to intervention reach. Reach was considered high if ≥50 % of hospitalized OUD patients received an MOUD order. Cross-case rating comparison identified attributes of high-performing hospitals and inductive and deductive approaches were used to identify themes. Results: Higher-performing hospitals exhibited attributes that were generally absent in lower-performing hospitals, including (1) complete medical provider staffing; (2) designated office space and resources for CATCH; (3) existing integrated OUD treatment resources; and (4) limited overlap between the implementation period and COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: Hospitals with attributes indicative of awareness and integration of OUD services into general care were generally higher performing than hospitals that had siloed OUD treatment programs. Future implementations of addiction consult services may benefit from an increased focus on hospital- and community-level buy-in and efforts to integrate MOUD treatment into general care. © 2024",10.1016/j.josat.2024.209528,Elsevier Inc.,0.0,Scopus,Addiction consult service; Hospital patient; Hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial; Implementation; Opioid use disorder; Substance-related disorder,Article,Chile,Journal of Computer Science
Impact of vaccination on Omicron's escape variants: Insights from fine-scale modelling of waning immunity in Hong Kong,Zou Y.; Lo W.-C.; Ming W.-K.; Yuan H.-Y.,2025,"COVID-19 vaccine-induced protection declines over time. This waning of immunity has been described in modelling as a lower level of protection. This study incorporated fine-scale vaccine waning into modelling to predict the next surge of the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In Hong Kong, the Omicron subvariant BA.2 caused a significant epidemic wave between February and April 2022, which triggered high vaccination rates. About half a year later, a second outbreak, dominated by a combination of BA.2, BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, began to spread. We developed mathematical equations to formulate continuous changes in vaccine boosting and waning based on empirical serological data. These equations were incorporated into a multi-strain discrete-time Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed model. The daily number of reported cases during the first Omicron outbreak, with daily vaccination rates, the population mobility index and daily average temperature, were used to train the model. The model successfully predicted the size and timing of the second surge and the variant replacement by BA.4/5. It estimated 655,893 cumulative reported cases from June 1, 2022 to 31 October 2022, which was only 2.69% fewer than the observed cumulative number of 674,008. The model projected that increased vaccine protection (by larger vaccine coverage or no vaccine waning) would reduce the size of the second surge of BA.2 infections substantially but would allow more subsequent BA.4/5 infections. Increased vaccine coverage or greater vaccine protection can reduce the infection rate during certain periods when the immune-escape variants co-circulate; however, new immune-escape variants spread more by out-competing the previous strain. © 2024 The Authors",10.1016/j.idm.2024.09.006,KeAi Communications Co.,0.0,Scopus,COVID-19; Discrete-time simulation; Epidemic model; Immune-escape; Waning immunity,Article,UK,Computers & Education

Longitudinal correlates of learning burnout among Chinese adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-lagged panel network analysis,Kan Y.; Wan B.; Chen Y.; Qiu X.; Qiao Z.; Zhou J.; Hu X.; Ke S.; Qiao K.; Liu X.; Bu T.; Zhang W.; Yang Y.,2025,"Background: Learning burnout as a serious psychological distress problem among adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic was investigated using the cross-lagged panel network models. Methods: A three-wave study using a sample of 11 to 18-year-olds in China was conducted, with baseline data collected in June 2020 (n = 4156) and follow-ups in December 2020 (n = 3209) and August 2021 (n = 2324). Two temporal cross-lagged panel network models were computed to analyze adolescent learning burnout over time. Results: The predictive pathway of adolescent learning burnout demonstrates significant temporal specificity. In the early outbreak period, Positive thinking, Appreciation of life and Depression are the most influential predictive symptoms. In the normalized epidemic prevention period, Goal planning, Affect control and Positive thinking are the most influential predictive symptoms. However, during this period, the extent to which adolescent learning burnout is predicted by other symptoms in the networks is significantly reduced. Limitations: The samples used in this study are not expected to be nationally representative, and therefore the generalizability of the results may be limited. Conclusions: These findings highlight the predictive roles of Positive thinking, Appreciation of life, and Depression in adolescent learning burnout and the importance of timely intervention on these symptoms in the early outbreak period of public health emergency similar to the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings also illustrate the essentiality of eliminate unstable factors in the school environment during the normalized epidemic prevention period. © 2024",10.1016/j.jad.2024.09.137,Elsevier B.V.,0.0,Scopus,Adolescent; CLPN; Depression; Learning burnout; Posttraumatic growth; Resilience,Article,India,ACM Transactions on Graphics
Exploring the HONO source during the COVID-19 pandemic in a megacity in China,Wang M.; Wang S.; Zhang R.; Yuan M.; Xu Y.; Shang L.; Song X.; Zhang X.; Zhang Y.,2025,"HONO is a critical precursor of •OH, but its sources are controversial due to its complex formation mechanism. This study conducted comprehensive observations in Zhengzhou from April 26 to May 11, 2022. Low NOx concentrations were observed during the Covid epidemic period (EP) (10.4 ± 3.0 ppb), compared to the pre-epidemic period (PEP) (12.5 ± 3.8 ppb). The mean HONO concentration during EP (0.53 ± 0.34 ppb) was 0.09 ppb lower than that during PEP (0.62 ± 0.53 ppb). The decrease in HONO concentration during EP came mainly at night due to the reduction in the direct emission (Pemi) (0.03 ppb/hr), the homogeneous reaction between •OH and NO (POH+NO) (0.02 ppb/hr), and the heterogeneous conversion of NO2 on the ground (0.01 ppb/hr). Notably, there was no significant change in daytime HONO concentration. The daytime HONO budget indicated that the primary HONO sources during PEP were the nitrate photolysis (Pnitrate), followed by the POH+NO, Pemi, the photo-enhanced reaction of NO2 on the ground (Pground+hv) and aerosol surface (Paerosol+hv). The primary HONO sources were Pnitrate, POH+NO, Pemi, and Paerosol+hv during EP, respectively. The missing source has a high correlation with solar radiation, there might be other photo-related HONO sources or the contributions of photosensitized reactions were underestimated.

This study included 88 patients with acute COVID-19 infection from Egypt. They were classified in to 3 groups with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 manifestation. Patients subjected to full history taking and clinical examination, CT scans of the chest, PCR test for Covid19 and blood sampling for vitamin D and Comprehensive inflammatory markers analysis. The present study reported statistically significant increase of age, dyspnea and respiratory rate (p <0.05) in sever infected groups than mild or moderate groups of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the primary analysis outcome was significantly associated mortality with reduced hemoglobin levels and elevated values of white blood cells, platelets, D-dimer, LDH, ferritin, blood urea and increased Prothrombin Time (p <0.05). However, insignificant statistical difference was found between the measured serum levels of Vitamin D in patients who recovered from those who died (96.58-± 38.34 vs 100.75 ± 80.62). This study concluded that COVID-19 severity correlates with multiple inflammatory biomarkers and coagulation factors.

Enabling Interdisciplinary Learning and Research through AI-Driven Transliteration of Historical Documents: A Case Study Proposal from Digital Humanities,Frincu S.; Frincu M.,2025,"The 4.0 revolution, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic, the unprecedented AI advances, and the pervasive digital technologies, have irreversibly shaped the teaching, learning, and research contexts to respond to the modern scholars' and students' needs and expectations. As a result, interdisciplinary methods have become a requisite for numerous higher education actors and are likely to produce faster and more complex knowledge acquisition and research results, irrespective of the application field. Using the literature criticism method, we set the general framework and highlight the necessity of crossdisciplinary approaches to engage and prepare students and support scholarly endeavors. Following the experience-based learning methodology, we set the context for our case study approach derived from a digital humanities R&D project outlining its interdisciplinary learning potential with benefits for students studying sciences and humanities. The analysis provides a detailed overview of its application in research in education and applicability to active learning methods for group work such as SCALE-UP. © 2025 Common Ground Research Networks.

"A square planar cobalt(II)-thiosemicarbazone complex. Synthesis, characterization, antiviral and anti-inflammatory potential",Atasever-Arslan B.; Kaya B.; Şahin O.; Ülküseven B.,2025,"Considering the possible antiviral effect of cobalt compounds and known pharmacological potential of thiosemicarbazones, a new combination containing cobalt(II) ions and tetradentate thiosemicarbazone was synthesized and structurally analyzed. In the complex structure (Co1), the cobalt ion is in 2+ oxidation state and is coordinated with ONNO donor set on the thiosemicarbazone backbone. The complex molecule crystallizes in the space group P21/m and the environment of the cobalt center tends to square planar geometry. The inhibitory performance of SARS-CoV-2 and the anti-inflammatory impact of the complex molecule were investigated. It was found that Co1 has high inhibitory effects on the SARS-CoV-2 virus's 3CL main protease enzyme, ACE2:SARS-CoV2 Spike RBD interaction, and IL8. Also, it showed significant anti-inflammatory effects on the release of IL6, IL8, IL10, and TGFβ1 cytokines and wound healing during in vitro TNF-α-induced inflammation. Experimental evidence demonstrates that Co1 diminishes both IL8 gene expression and protein levels. According to in silico and experimental results, it has a drug potential. Assessing the in vivo impacts of Co1 might contribute to understanding its potential as an antiviral and anti-inflammatory agent. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.molstruc.2024.140109,Elsevier B.V.,0.0,Scopus,Cobalt; COVID19; IL8; Inflammation; SARS-CoV-2; Thiosemicarbazone,Article,Italy,Computers & Education
HCO-RLF: Hybrid classification optimization using recurrent learning and fuzzy for COVID-19 detection on CT images,Balasamy K.; Seethalakshmi V.,2025,"COVID-19 infection detection through initial lesion classification provides early diagnosis and prevents breathing difficulties. Detecting the infectious part of the lungs using computerized tomography (CT) images has become an instantaneous detection method. In this article, a Hybrid Classification Optimization (HCO) using Recurrent Leaning and Fuzzy (RLF) is proposed. The neural network classifies infected and non-infected regions using pixel distributions and their variations. This is performed by identifying missing features and training the recurrent network using regional differences. Based on the feature availability, recurrent learning classifies the region through the input dataset and recurrent training correlation. The fuzzy predicts missing features through substituted derivatives obtained between wide ranges of variations. In this process, the maximum fuzzy derivatives for feature substitution are used for infected region prediction. The least fuzzy derivatives are prevented from the training layer to reduce false rates in region classification. This joint process improves the training consistency to leverage the detection and region classification accuracies. The proposed HCO-RLF improves detection and classification accuracy, and precision by 11.96 %, 9.98 %, and 13.42 % for the varying classification rates. Besides, the results are obtained in comparison with the existing DR-MIL, DSAE, and BS-FSA methods discussed later in the article. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.bspc.2024.106951,Elsevier Ltd,0.0,Scopus,COVID detection; CT image; Feature extraction; Fuzzy derivatives; Recurrent network,Article,UK,ACM Transactions on Graphics
Regional variations in HIV diagnosis in Japan before and during the COVID-19 pandemic,Nishiura H.; Fujiwara S.; Imamura A.; Shirasaka T.,2025,"Background: The number of people undergoing voluntary HIV testing has abruptly decreased since 2020. The geographical heterogeneity of HIV infection and the impact of COVID-19 on the diagnosis of HIV at regional level are important to understand. This study aimed to estimate the HIV incidence by geographical region and understand how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced diagnosis of HIV. Methods: We used an extended back-calculation method to reconstruct the epidemiological dynamics of HIV/AIDS by geographical region. We used eight regions: Tokyo, the capital of Japan, Hokkaido plus Tohoku, Kanto plus Koshinetsu (excluding Tokyo), Hokuriku, Tokai, Kinki, Chugoku plus Shikoku, and Kyushu plus Okinawa. Four different epidemiological measurements were evaluated: (i) estimated HIV incidence, (ii) estimated rate of diagnosis, (iii) number of undiagnosed HIV infections, and (iv) proportion of HIV infections that had been diagnosed. Results: The incidence of HIV/AIDS during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 to 2022 increased in all regions except Kanto/Koshinetsu (51.3 cases/year), Tokyo (183.9 cases/year), Hokuriku (1.0 cases/year), and Tokai (43.1 cases/year). The proportion of HIV infections that had been diagnosed only exceeded 90% in Tokyo (91.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 90.6, 93.3), Kanto/Koshinetsu (91.0%, 95% CI: 87.3, 97.8), and Kinki (92.5%, 95% CI: 90.4, 95.9). The proportion of infections that had been diagnosed was estimated at 83.3% (95% CI: 75.1, 98.7) in Chugoku/Shikoku and 80.5% (95% CI: 73.9, 91.0) in Kyusyu/Okinawa. Conclusions: In urban regions with major metropolitan cities, including Tokyo, Kinki, and Kanto/Koshinetsu, the number of undiagnosed HIV infections is substantial. However, the proportion of undiagnosed infections was estimated to be smaller than in other regions. The diagnosed proportion was the lowest in Kyusyu/Okinawa (80.5%), followed by Chugoku/Shikoku and Hokkaido/Tohoku. The level of diagnosis in those regional prefectures may have been more influenced and damaged by the COVID-19 pandemic than in urban settings. © 2024 The Authors",10.1016/j.idm.2024.08.004,KeAi Communications Co.,0.0,Scopus,AIDS; Community; Geographical variations; Heterogeneity; Incidence; Statistical estimation,Article,Germany,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
"Crystal structures, NCI-RDG, Hirshfeld surface and energy framework analysis of tetra aryl substitute bispidine and oxaquinuclidine core containing derivatives: A potential COVID-19 drug candidate",Vengatesh G.; Vinushya N.; Jeyaprakash G.M.; Mohini A.; Mondal P.; Reddy R.; Shriram Z.O.,2025,"Two of the title compounds are crystallized in P21/c and monoclinic face groups. Each crystal unit cell has four molecules. There are two piperidine rings: one in the chair conformation and another one in the boat conformation. The piperidine nitrogen in the boat conformation is joined to the oxygen-containing chair conformation piperidine ring to produce the oxaquinuclidine ring (-N-CH2O-). Furthermore, because of the steric barrier between rings, all aryl groups are oriented in an equatorial position. The crystal network is maintained through several interactions, including C—H⋯O/N/Cl/π. The crystal void and interaction energy studies gave additional evidence of the strength of the crystal packing and intermolecular linkage. Crystal 3b has less cavity than crystal 3c, indicating that it is densely packed. The dispersion energy contribution dominates the stability, according to the analysis of the electrostatic, dispersion, and total energy frameworks. Reduced density gradient (RDG), electron localization function (ELF), and localized orbital locator (LOL) analysis were used to determine the molecular interaction, electron pair density, and maximally localized orbitals overlapping sites, respectively. This approach reveals that oxaquinuclidine ring steric hindrance and the electron densities throughout the molecules. Density function theory (DFT) provides more evidence for the ring's orientation and the molecules' reactivity. A molecular docking investigation of four essential COVID-19 proteins was carried out using these theoretical ideas. This investigation demonstrates that each protein's reactivity varies; certain proteins have more interaction with high electron density molecules (electron-donating substituent), while others have more interaction with low electron density molecules (electron-withdrawing substituent). The ADMET and drug-likeness investigations reveal that methoxy group substituted molecules perfectly correlate with the required pharmacological characteristics. The cytotoxicity of the five compounds was assessed using the HEK293T cell. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.molstruc.2024.140202,Elsevier B.V.,0.0,Scopus,COVID-19 protein docking; Crystal structure; Hirshfeld surface; Interaction energy; NCI-RDG; Piperidine,Article,Brazil,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
A quasi-experimental investigation of differences between face-to-face and videoconference interviews in an actual selection process,Langer M.; Demetriou A.; Arvanitidis A.; Vanderveken S.; Hiemstra A.M.F.,2025,"Videoconference interviews are now integral to many selection processes. Theoretical arguments and empirical findings suggest that videoconference interviews may lead to different interview performance ratings in comparison to Face-to-Face (FTF) interviews. This has led to the question of the comparability of the psychometric properties of videoconferences and FTF interviews. However, evidence from actual selection processes stems from the beginning of the century, and recent findings predominantly stem from simulated interview contexts. We present insights from an actual selection process within a large European organization where we had the unique opportunity for a quasi-experimental investigation of differences between videoconference and FTF interviews. Initially, the organization conducted FTF interviews, and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the interviews were conducted via videoconference. We examine mean differences in applicant performance ratings and evidence for response format-related validity differences. There were only small, non-significant mean differences and no evidence for response format related validity differences. We discuss possible causes for discrepancies in our findings compared to previous research. Furthermore, we conclude that downstream consequences of differences between FTF and videoconference interviews may be lower than previously expected. We end with a call for research on the interaction between technology-design and selection-tool-design features. © 2024 The Author(s).

Predicting the number of COVID-19 imported cases based on cross-modal transformer: A case study in China,Zhang W.; Xie R.; Li J.; Wang L.; Li X.; Peng P.,2025,"With the global outbreak of COVID-19, an increasing number of countries have made imported epidemic control a priority, imposing restriction measures to prevent the spread of the virus caused by imported cases. To control the imported epidemic, it is necessary to accurately predict the number of imported cases from different source countries. This paper proposes a novel time series prediction approach called PNICA (Prediction on Number of Imported CAses) that uses deep learning to predict the number of COVID-19 imported cases. On the one hand, the proposed PNICA approach adopts a multi-modal learning strategy to fuse three sources of data: flight data, the epidemic data, and the data of historical imported cases. On the other hand, the proposed PNICA approach extends the traditional transformer model with cross-modal attention to learn the interactions between different data modalities to improve prediction accuracy. We use China as the target country and collect the number of imported cases from four source countries—Japan, USA, Russia, and the UK—as well as the epidemic data and flight data from May to November 2020. Experiments on the collected data demonstrate that the proposed PNICA approach outperforms the baseline methods in predicting the number of imported cases. The ablation study shows that both the multi-modal learning strategy and cross-modal attention can significantly improve prediction performance. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.eswa.2024.125483,Elsevier Ltd,0.0,Scopus,COVID-19; Cross-modal attention; Imported case prediction; Multi-modal learning strategy; Transformer model,Article,France,Computers & Education

Objective: to identify class or profiles of patients hospitalized and treated with COVID-19 pneumonia using latent class clustering methods to assess the clinical and prognostic relevance of the resulting patients’ profiles. Poor prognosis was defined as death or need for ICU admission, good prognosis, the opposite. With special interest in differential responses to calcifediol. Setting: Reina Sofia University Hospital, Córdoba Spain. Patients: Retrospective observational cohort study of patients admitted for COVID-19. ClinicalTrials.gov public database (NCT05819918). Inclusion criteria: (i) Age ≥ 18 and ≤ 90 years, (ii) Pneumonia characterized by the presence of infiltrates on chest X-ray or CT scan, (iii) SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed, and (iv) CURB Scale 65 >1. Design: Latent class analysis, for obtaining homogeneous clusters, without specifying a priori the belonging group, and selecting the optimal number of clusters by minimizing information criteria. Evaluating the differences between groups for each variable by means of chi-square, Fisher's exact test and Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: 707 patients hospitalized from 10 March 2020 until 4 March 2022 were included. For the treatment variable, differences were found between class 3 (60 % treated with calcifediol only) and classes 1 (less than 1 % calcifediol only vs. 82 % treated with both), 2 (less than 1 % calcifediol only vs. 82 % treated with both) and 4 (1 % calcifediol only vs. 84 % treated with both). Class 3, (60 % with calcifediol), had a significantly better prognosis compared to patients treated with glucocorticoids alone (OR: 15.2, 95 % CI: [3.73–142], p<0.001) or no treatment (OR: 7.38, 95 % CI: [2.63–30.2], p<0.001).

Challenges and aspirations: lived experiences of teacher-education student-mothers of a state university,Fabillar J.P.; Once F.P.; Gabon V.A.,2025,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions in education globally leading to the implementation of different learning modalities. And it highly affects the most vulnerable groups such as women and children. This study explored the lived experiences of teacher-education student-mothers of a state university in the Philippines towards the end of the pandemic using a phenomenological approach. Twenty-one student-mothers voluntarily participated in the study who were i) bona fide students of the campus, ii) biological mothers, iii) married or living together with a partner, and iv) living with their child. From the data analyses, four major themes emerged: i) unexpected pregnancy, ii) heightened stress during the pandemic, iii) maintaining a positive outlook in life, and iv) managing dual roles. These results implied that the teacher-education student-mothers were highly stressed during the pandemic but they had extrinsic motivators to finish studies such as their children and family. The lived experiences of teacher-education student-mothers can serve as an inspiration to other students to pursue their studies even amid adversities. It is recommended that there must be an enhancement of student services tailored to support the mental health of marginalized students. © 2025, Intelektual Pustaka Media Utama.

Midwives’ perceptions and experiences of recommending and delivering vaccinations to pregnant women following the Covid-19 pandemic: a qualitative study,Grimley D.C.; Atherton P.H.; Bick P.D.; Clarke L.; Hillman D.S.; Parsons D.J.,2025,"Background: Pregnant women and their unborn babies are at an increased risk of hospitalisation, morbidity, and mortality from illness. However, uptake of influenza, pertussis and Covid-19 vaccinations offered during pregnancy is below the desired rate. This research aims to explore UK midwives’ experiences of approaching and discussing vaccinations with pregnant women, and their perceived role in pregnant women's vaccination decisions. Methods: Midwives in the West Midlands, UK were recruited via participating hospitals and midwife specific social media groups. Interviews were conducted remotely from April to July 2023 and analysed with a deductive codebook coding strategy using thematic analysis. Findings: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 midwives identifying the following key themes: Recommendations to have vaccinations reported on the contents of recommendations and how they are communicated; Messages and guidance included the importance of up-to-date informational needs for midwives to administer vaccinations and the barriers caused by uncertainty and conflicting messages about the Covid-19 vaccine during pregnancy; Delivery of vaccinations included the convenience of offering vaccinations during standard antenatal appointments; and Midwives’ barriers explored the pandemic specific and other barriers midwives face in the administering of vaccinations. Discussion: These findings contribute to the understanding of how midwives discuss the topic of vaccinations with pregnant women. This research highlights the importance for midwives to receive clear and consistent information. A strong emphasis on why vaccines are important when recommending to pregnant women in addition to standard information on the availability and timing may have a bearing in helping women to make informed decisions about accepting vaccinations. © 2024 The Authors",10.1016/j.midw.2024.104206,Churchill Livingstone,0.0,Scopus,Antenatal; Covid-19; Midwife; Pregnancy; Qualitative research; Vaccination,Article,Canada,Nature Communications
Repair strategies for nonunion in old osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures: a case analysis,Xingcheng Z.; Jun W.; Ming L.,2025,"BACKGROUND: Patients with osteoporotic compression fractures of the lumbar spine have varying degrees of changes in the sagittal parameters of the spine and pelvis, resulting in disequilibrium and rebalancing of the sagittal plane of the whole spine/lumbar spine. If the primary osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture is not treated promptly, it develops into an old osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture with nonunion over time. OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of percutaneous vertebroplasty in nine patients with old osteoporotic lumbar compression fracture with nonunion. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of nine elderly patients with old osteoporotic lumbar compression fractures with nonunion treated in the Orthopedics Department of Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from September 2018 to August 2022. All patients underwent revision treatment with percutaneous vertebroplasty and received regular anti-osteoporosis treatment and rehabilitation training. The lumbar spine X-ray plain film and three-dimensional CT test results were reviewed before discharge and during follow-up to evaluate the diffusion of bone cement. Visual analog scale score, lumbar Oswestry disability index score, and Roussouly classification were recorded before, after surgery and during follow-up. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) During postoperative follow-up, none of the 9 cases in this group experienced serious surgical complications such as nerve injury, infection, bone cement leakage, pulmonary embolism, and allergic shock, and no adverse reactions related to bone cement occurred. One patient died of respiratory failure due to COVID-19 infection 2 years after operation. (2) The visual analog scale score and Oswestry disability index score of postoperative pain in patients with recurrent vertebral fractures after percutaneous vertebroplasty were significantly lower than those before revision surgery. After the last follow-up percutaneous vertebroplasty revision surgery, the Roussouly classification of patients significantly improved. There was no statistically significant difference between the changes in vertebral body height during the last follow-up measurement and preoperative comparison. (3) These findings indicate that for patients with old osteoporotic lumbar compression fractures with nonunion, moderate injection of bone cement and effective dispersion of bone cement have a significant relieving effect on postoperative pain. Regular anti-osteoporosis and effective postoperative rehabilitation training can help patients improve their postoperative lumbar spine function. © 2025, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

Relationship matters: Using machine learning methods to predict the mental health severity of Chinese college freshmen during the pandemic period,Kong W.; Pei Z.; Guo Z.; Xu R.; Zhao J.,2025,"Background: Pandemics act as stressors and may lead to frequent mental health disorders. College student, especially freshmen, are particularly susceptible to experiencing intense mental stress reactions during a pandemic. We aimed to identify stable and intervenable variables including academic, relationship and economic factors, and focused on their impact on mental health severity during the pandemic period. Methods: We innovatively combined diverse machine learning methods, including XGBoost, SHAP, and K-means clustering, to predict the mental health severity of college freshmen. A total of 3281 college freshmen participated in the research. Discriminant analyses were performed on groups of participants with depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7). All characteristic variables were selected based on their importance and interventionability. Further analyses were conducted with selected features to determine the optimal variable combination. Results: XGBoost analysis revealed that relationship factors exhibited the highest predictive capacity for mental health severity among college freshmen (SHAPFamily Relationship = 0.373; SHAPPeer Support = 0.236). The impact of academic factors on college freshmen's mental health severity depended on their intricate interplay with relationship factors, resulting in complex interactive effects. These effects were heterogeneous among different subgroups. Conclusions: The proposed machine learning approach utilizing XGBoost, SHAP and K-means clustering methods provides a valuable tool to gain insights into the relative contributions of academic, relationship and economic factors to Chinese college freshmen's mental health severity during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Transmission of respiratory diseases in high-metabolic environments: A case study of gym,Zhang H.; Zhao P.; Dou Z.; Su B.; Li Y.; Zhang N.,2025,"Outbreaks of respiratory infectious diseases have often been reported in fitness centers, likely attributed to high population density, extensive shared surfaces, and elevated metabolic equivalent (MET) levels. This study analyzed the behaviors of 30 gym attendees to establish a connection between exercise intensity and virus exposure. Close interactions among participants were tracked using self-developed wearable devices that utilized computer vision technologies, while surface-contact behaviors were recorded using video cameras. A multi-route transmission model for respiratory infectious diseases was subsequently created, integrating the observed behaviors. The Omicron variant of COVID-19 served as a case study to evaluate infection risk via various transmission routes and to assess the efficacy of interventions. The METs during physical activity were about 3.5 times higher than those recorded at rest. The average interpersonal distance during close interactions in the gym was measured at 0.82 m, with 36.7 % of interactions occurring face-to-face. On average, the participants made contact with surfaces 770.3 times per hour, with 517.5 of these contacts involving public surfaces. The hourly infection rate was calculated at 18.5 %, with long-range airborne transmission and close contact accounting for 70.1 % and 28.5 % of the cases, respectively. To mitigate transmission risk, several intervention scenarios were modeled. These included (1) 100 % mask-wearing with N95 masks and occupancy reduced to 62 % (25 m2/person); (2) 100 % mask-wearing with surgical masks and occupancy reduced to 26 % (59.6 m2/person); (3) no mask-wearing, with occupancy reduced to 18 % (86.1 m2/person). All scenarios fulfilled the criteria for achieving an Rt below 1, indicating that under these conditions, gyms could be reopened safely. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.buildenv.2024.112161,Elsevier Ltd,0.0,Scopus,COVID-19; Epidemic prevention and control; Gym; Human behavior; Metabolic equivalent (MET),Article,Chile,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
Airborne fungal communities are more susceptible to anthropogenic activities than bacteria,Pan Y.; Zuo Z.; Huang X.; Zhu R.,2025,"Airborne microorganisms (AM) have significant environmental and health implications. Extensive studies have been conducted to investigate the factors influencing the composition and diversity of AM. However, the knowledge of AM with anthropogenic activities has not reach a consensus. In this study, we took advantage of the dramatic decline of outdoor anthropogenic activities resulting from COVID-19 lockdown to reveal their associations. We collected airborne particulate matter before and during the lockdown period in two cities. The results showed that it was fungal diversity and communities but not bacteria obviously different between pre-lockdown and lockdown samples, suggesting that airborne fungi were more susceptible to anthropogenic activities than bacteria. However, after the implementation of lockdown, the co-occurrence networks of both bacterial and fungal community became more complex, which might be due to the variation of microbial sources. Furthermore, Mantel test and correlation analysis showed that air pollutants also partly contributed to microbial alterations. Airborne fungal community was more affected by air pollutants than bacterial community. Notably, some human pathogens like Nigrospora and Arthrinium were negatively correlated with air pollutants.

The COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant increase in sales of dietary supplements, including ginseng supplements, to purportedly support immune health and provide other health benefits. However, this heightened demand has subsequently increased the risk of adulteration in these dietary supplements. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of a novel combination of DNA barcoding and multiplex PCR to identify species in ginseng supplements. A total of 50 commercial ginseng supplements containing Panax ginseng, Panax quinquefolius, or Panax notoginseng were obtained from an online vendor. Two composite samples per product were subjected to DNA extraction followed by multiplex PCR and DNA barcoding with three genetic targets (i.e., rbcL, matK, and ITS2). Of the three DNA barcoding markers, ITS2 had the highest amplification success at 74%, and matK had the highest sequencing success at 60%. DNA barcoding alone identified species in 68% of products, while multiplex PCR had an overall 60% identification rate. The combination of both methods resulted in a 72% species identification rate. In addition to improving the overall identification rate, the combination of both methods allowed for greater species resolution and the detection of undeclared plant species. Future research should explore combining DNA-based methods with chemical-based approaches to improve ginseng detection capabilities and enable the quantification of undeclared adulterants. © 2024 The Authors",10.1016/j.foodcont.2024.110893,Elsevier Ltd,0.0,Scopus,Adulteration; Dietary supplements; DNA barcoding; Ginseng; Multiplex PCR; Species identification,Article,Spain,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
Analysis of financial contagion among economic sectors through Dynamic Bayesian Networks,Costa Fonseca N.; Vinícius de França Carvalho J.,2025,"Crises severely impact economies and may spread across regions or sectors in a process called contagion. Understanding this process is crucial for anticipating crises’ effects and implementing mitigative strategies. Specific economic sectors may be major crisis propagators: banking and insurance are often considered decisive in this context. This study employs Dynamic Bayesian Networks to model sectoral interdependencies within the U.S. economy, utilizing daily data from nine Dow Jones industrial indices over the period 2000–2020. As a secondary objective, we evaluate whether the insurance industry plays a central role in spreading crises. Several crisis periods are analyzed, from dot-com bubble to Covid-19 pandemic. The results reveal the subprime crisis, European debt crisis and the 2016 presidential election as the main contagious periods. The last analyzed period – Covid-19 pandemic – was divided in two phases, showing, on phase 1, an interconnected economic system with three main spreaders (Oil & Gas, Real Estate and Pharmaceutical) and, on phase 2, the same configuration of the post-subprime. Furthermore, although the insurance sector was somehow relevant during subprime crisis, it primarily acts as a contagion receptor, specially from the banking sector, with the correlation between them being the highest of all, reaching 0.49 at the last period. © 2024",10.1016/j.eswa.2024.125448,Elsevier Ltd,0.0,Scopus,Contagion; Dynamic Bayesian Networks; Financial Crises; Sectorial Indices,Article,Chile,Journal of Computer Science
"Interplay of calcium, vitamin D, and parathormone in the milieu of infections and immunity: Reassessed in the context of COVID-19",Bandyopadhyay U.; Sen D.; Ahuja D.; Mahapatra S.P.; Biswas D.; Maiti R.; Chakraborty S.; Hazra A.; Parua S.; Basak A.K.; Das A.; Paul N.; Purkait M.P.; Syamal A.K.; Dey R.; Bhattacharya K.; Adhikary K.; Bhattacharjee A.,2025,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is recognized for inducing severe respiratory symptoms like cough, and shortness of breathing. Although symptom severity varies, some individuals remain asymptomatic. This virus has sparked a global pandemic, imposing a substantial rate of mortality or morbidity, with extended periods of illness reported. People with underlying medical issues and the elderly are more likely to experience adverse results. The virus's frequent mutations pose challenges for medical professionals, necessitating adaptable therapeutic and preventive strategies. Vitamin D, a versatile regulatory molecule, not only influences physiological processes such as serum calcium regulation but also exhibits immunomodulatory functions. Calcium ions play a crucial role as secondary signal transduction molecules, impacting diverse cellular functions and maintaining homeostasis through ion channel regulation. Parathormone, another key regulator of serum calcium, often acts antagonistically to vitamin D. This review delves into the interplay of vitamin D, calcium, and parathormone, exploring their possible influence on the progression of COVID-19. The intricate signaling involving these elements contributes to adverse prognosis, emphasizing the need for comprehensive understanding.

Voice handicap prevalence among healthcare workers in China and Indonesia,Song Z.; Lee P.J.; Sarwono S.J.; Hidayati N.,2025,"This study investigated the prevalence of voice disorders among healthcare workers in China and Indonesia. A questionnaire was administered to 721 healthcare workers, with 411 from China and 310 from Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire assessed vocal-related symptoms, perceived voice handicap, frequently heard noise sources, and the quality of communications. The results revealed that the most frequently reported symptoms were ‘voice tiredness’ (20.5 %) and ‘clearing the throat’ (18.3 %). Specifically, 19.4 % of Chinese healthcare workers experienced voice-related symptoms, whereas only 6.3 % of Indonesians reported such symptoms. Longer working hours and working years were significantly associated with voice-related symptoms. Furthermore, the healthcare workers in China and Indonesia both reported mild (<30) voice disorders based on the Voice Handicap Index (VHI-30). Approximately one-fourth (23.8 %) of healthcare workers in China had VHI-30 scores exceeding 30, compared to only 7 % in Indonesia. The differences in vocal-related symptoms and voice handicap between the two countries were significant. Healthcare workers with 50–60 working hours per week exhibited higher scores than those working 40–50 h per week in both countries. Additionally, communication quality and the severity of voice problems for healthcare workers in China were worse than in Indonesia during the pandemic. © 2024 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.apacoust.2024.110310,Elsevier Ltd,0.0,Scopus,Face mask; Healthcare workers; Noise; Pandemic; Voice handicap; voice handicap index (VHI),Article,Australia,Journal of Computer Science
Shuangdan Jiedu Decoction improved LPS-induced acute lung injury by regulating both cGAS-STING pathway and inflammasome,Yao Q.; Wen J.; Chen S.; Wang Y.; Wen X.; Wang X.; Li C.; Zheng C.; Li J.; Ma Z.; Zhan X.; Xiao X.; Bai Z.,2025,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: Shuangdan Jiedu Decoction (SJD) is a formula composed of six Chinese herbs with heat-removing and detoxifying, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory effects, which is clinically used in the therapy of various inflammatory diseases of the lungs including COVID-19, but the therapeutic material basis of its action as well as its molecular mechanism are still unclear. Aim of the study: The study attempted to determine the therapeutic effect of SJD on LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI), as well as to investigate its mechanism of action and assess its therapeutic potential for the cure of inflammation-related diseases in the clinical setting. Materials and methods: We established an ALI model by tracheal drip LPS, and after the administration of SJD, we collected the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissues of mice and examined the expression of inflammatory factors in them. In addition, we evaluated the effects of SJD on the cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase –stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) and inflammasome by immunoblotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Results: We demonstrated that SJD was effective in alleviating LPS-induced ALI by suppressing the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the BALF, improving the level of lung histopathology and the number of neutrophils, as well as decreasing the inflammatory factor-associated gene expression. Importantly, we found that SJD could inhibit multiple stimulus-driven activation of cGAS-STING and inflammasome. Further studies showed that the Chinese herbal medicines in SJD had no influence on the cGAS-STING pathway and inflammasome alone at the formulated dose. By increasing the concentration of these herbs, we observed inhibitory effects on the cGAS-STING pathway and inflammasome, and the effect exerted was maximal when the six herbs were combined, indicating that the synergistic effects among these herbs plays a crucial role in the anti-inflammatory effects of SJD. Conclusions: Our research demonstrated that SJD has a favorable protective effect against ALI, and its mechanism of effect may be associated with the synergistic effect exerted between six Chinese medicines to inhibit the cGAS-STING and inflammasome abnormal activation. These results are favorable for the wide application of SJD in the clinic as well as for the development of drugs for ALI from herbal formulas. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.jep.2024.118661,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,0.0,Scopus,Acute lung injury; cGAS-STING pathway; Inflammasome; Shuangdan Jiedu Decoction; Synergistic effect,Article,India,Computers & Education
Measuring the efficiency of administrative divisions in combating the COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan: an empirical study,Chen S.-P.; Lin Y.-R.,2025,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to have a substantial impact on the economies and livelihoods of all countries. Central and local government administrators are facing a critical issue of resource utilization efficiency due to their limited resources. This paper employs data envelopment analysis (DEA) and the concept of an assurance region (AR) to assess the relative efficiency of administrative divisions in Taiwan, whose effectiveness has been praised by other countries’ administrators and citizens, regarding COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control. The input factors used were the cumulative number of deaths (an undesirable factor) and expenditures, and the output factors were the average number of unconfirmed citizens aged 65 and older, the average number of unconfirmed citizens aged 0–64, and the cumulative number of vaccinations. Notably, because there are many COVID-19 variants with different characteristics, reaching a consensus AR among experts is difficult. Thus, different ARs were compared, and the most representative AR was identified for subsequent analysis. The main findings show that only Kaohsiung City was efficient, and Taipei City was the third worst due to inefficient operations. In addition, the administrative divisions were classified into four groups using cluster analysis based on the decomposition of aggregate efficiency to the contributions of the three outputs. The findings presented in this paper serve as a reference for both local government administrators and citizens, offering insights into relative efficiency and improvement directions. Moreover, they also provide guidance for resource allocation, future strategy adjustment, and development for central government administrators and citizens worldwide. © 2023 International Federation of Operational Research Societies.",10.1111/itor.13341,John Wiley and Sons Inc,1.0,Scopus,assurance region; cluster analysis; data envelopment analysis; efficiency,Article,Italy,Computers & Education
Continuous micro feeding and mixing of solid dosage forms under vibrational excitation,Lu H.; Zhang L.; Du H.; Guo X.; Liu H.,2025,Continuous manufacturing has intrigued many researchers in the pharmaceutical industry in the post-COVID-19 world. We experimentally studied the discharge characteristics of pharmaceutical excipients under vibrational excitation. The successful accurate dosing and filling of powders at fill rates of 0.6–15 mg/s was developed. A simple particle model includes fluid-grain coupling which is relevant to Faraday tilting resulting from gas trapped in the powder bed accurately predicts the discharge rate. A novel continuous micro mixing system was designed based on the discharge model. Any specified proportions can be realized by setting appropriate vibration parameters. The low variability (<2.5 %) in the content of components has verified the reliability of the mixing system. The continuous mixing performance was determined by the discharge characteristics. Yet the particle size distribution and cohesion lead to different mixing performances when the stability of micro feeding is satisfied. Reasonable process parameters for continuous mixing are determined and optimized. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd,10.1016/j.ces.2024.120704,Elsevier Ltd,0.0,Scopus,Cohesive powders; Continuous manufacturing; Continuous mixing; Hopper discharge; Localized vibration,Article,Germany,Nature Communications
Depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation among university students before and after the COVID-19 pandemic,Macalli M.; Castel L.; Jacqmin-Gadda H.; Galesne C.; Tournier M.; Galéra C.; Pereira E.; Tzourio C.,2025,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown have had negative effects on students' mental health. However, little information is available regarding the frequencies of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation during the post-pandemic period. We aimed to determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation among French university students. Methods: In this comparative study, 4463 students were recruited during the pre-COVID-19 pandemic period (2013-2020) and 1768 students, during the post-COVID-19 pandemic period (2022-2023). Standardized frequencies of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation were compared between the two time periods. Changes in the level of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation between the pre- and post-pandemic periods, were then analyzed using interrupted time series analysis. Results: Compared to participants from the pre-pandemic sample, participants from the post-pandemic sample had higher standardized rates of depressive symptoms (40.6 % vs 25.6 %) and suicidal ideation (29.3 % vs 21.1 %). Segmented logistic regression showed an about 50 % increased risk of depressive symptoms (aOR, 1.47; 95 % CI, 1.01–2.13) and a 100 % increased risk of suicidal ideation (aOR, 2.00; 95 % CI, 1.33–3.00) in the post-pandemic period. Before the pandemic, there was no significant time-trend for depressive symptoms (aOR, 1.002; 95 % CI, 0.999–1.006) and suicidal thoughts (0.999–1.006; aOR, 0.999; 95 % CI, 0.995–1.002). Limitations: Potential biases related to self-selection of participants in the study and information bias. History of depression and suicide attempt were self-reported. Conclusions: These findings reveal an alarming deterioration of students' mental health in the post-pandemic period compared to the pre-pandemic era. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.jad.2024.09.093,Elsevier B.V.,0.0,Scopus,COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Suicidal ideation; University students,Article,Brazil,PLOS ONE
A data science pipeline applied to Australia's 2022 COVID-19 Omicron waves,Trauer J.M.; Hughes A.E.; Shipman D.S.; Meehan M.T.; Henderson A.S.; McBryde E.S.; Ragonnet R.,2025,"The field of software engineering is advancing at astonishing speed, with packages now available to support many stages of data science pipelines. These packages can support infectious disease modelling to be more robust, efficient and transparent, which has been particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed a package for the construction of infectious disease models, integrated it with several open-source libraries and applied this composite pipeline to multiple data sources that provided insights into Australia's 2022 COVID-19 epidemic. We aimed to identify the key processes relevant to COVID-19 transmission dynamics and thereby develop a model that could quantify relevant epidemiological parameters. The pipeline's advantages include markedly increased speed, an expressive application programming interface, the transparency of open-source development, easy access to a broad range of calibration and optimisation tools and consideration of the full workflow from input manipulation through to algorithmic generation of the publication materials. Extending the base model to include mobility effects slightly improved model fit to data, with this approach selected as the model configuration for further epidemiological inference. Under our assumption of widespread immunity against severe outcomes from recent vaccination, incorporating an additional effect of the main vaccination programs rolled out during 2022 on transmission did not further improve model fit. Our simulations suggested that one in every two to six COVID-19 episodes were detected, subsequently emerging Omicron subvariants escaped 30–60% of recently acquired natural immunity and that natural immunity lasted only one to eight months on average. We documented our analyses algorithmically and present our methods in conjunction with interactive online code notebooks and plots. We demonstrate the feasibility of integrating a flexible domain-specific syntax library with state-of-the-art packages in high performance computing, calibration, optimisation and visualisation to create an end-to-end pipeline for infectious disease modelling. We used the resulting platform to demonstrate key epidemiological characteristics of the transition from the emergency to the endemic phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2024 The Authors",10.1016/j.idm.2024.08.005,KeAi Communications Co.,0.0,Scopus,Computational simulation; COVID-19; Epidemiology; Software design,Article,Canada,Nature Communications
Internet-based therapist-supported interpersonal psychotherapy for depression: A randomized controlled trial,Käll A.; Bäck M.; Fahlroth O.; Ekeflod E.; Lundberg A.; Viberg N.; Andersson G.,2025,"Background: Depression is a common disorder for which there are several treatments options including different psychological treatments. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of internet-based interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) for symptoms of depression in randomized controlled trial. Methods: Following recruitment via advertisement a total of 113 participants with mild to moderate symptoms of depression were included and randomized to either a ten-week internet-based IPT with weekly therapist guidance or a waitlist control condition. The primary outcome was symptoms of depression measured weekly with the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S) and at pre- and post-treatment assessment with the Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI-II). Secondary outcomes were self-rated quality of life and symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder. We also measured therapeutic alliance and treatment credibility. Outcomes were evaluated with a latent growth curve model (for MADRS-S) and robust linear regression models (for the other measures). The trial was conducted during the Covid-19 pandemic in the spring of 2021. Results: Significant differences favoring the treatment group were found on three of the four outcomes: BDI-II, quality of life ratings, and ratings of generalized anxiety. Between-group effect sizes for these outcomes were moderate (BDI-II, quality of life) or small (generalized anxiety). The latent growth curve model did not indicate a significant difference on the weekly MADRS-S ratings. Exploratory analyses did not show an association between therapeutic alliance, treatment credibility and outcome. Limitations: Missing data at post-treatment was high in the treatment group (37 %), though the missingness was not significantly related to observed ratings at pre-treatment or estimated trajectories during the treatment. Few participants completed all modules. The Covid-19 pandemic situation may have affected both effects and dropout rates. Conclusions: Internet-based IPT can lead to significant improvements, though the reductions in symptoms of depression were not consistent across the two measures used. Completion rates and dropout patterns suggest a need for improved acceptability. Trial registration: The trial was preregistered at Clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04721678).

"Using geothermal energy in enhancing all-air HVAC system performance - Case study, thermal analysis and economic insights",Darwiche M.; Faraj J.; Ali S.; Murr R.; Taher R.; El Hage H.; Khaled M.,2025,"The background is the same for addressing the twin challenges of attaining thermal comfort and concurrently reducing energy use and CO2 emissions. As a safeguard against worsening contamination, combining geothermal energy with an All-Air Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning system (HVAC) with 100 % fresh air intake is also crucial in the context of the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, this study suggests using geothermal energy as a backup source to run a typical All-Air centralized HVAC system. The resulting system is referred to as a combined system from now on, and its primary goals are to lower the amount of operating energy needed while being environmentally and financially sound. In this context, the creative way of combining the suggested geothermal duct with the All-Air HVAC system possesses various insights, as demonstrated by the thorough thermal analysis and related design. Strong conclusions were derived from a thorough case study focused on Lebanon: adding 100 % fresh air intake leads to an astounding yearly energy savings of 67 %, whereas configurations with 10 % and 30 % fresh air produced energy savings of 52 % and 36 %, respectively. In the study, a geothermal multi-duct system was also suggested and looked at. The research revealed that the 311-m length of the single geothermal duct connected to a pressure of 7000 Pa was reduced to 210 m and the pressure drop was lowered to 140 Pa when a geothermal multi-duct system was employed. Furthermore, as the computed payback period makes clear, the integrated system presents an appealing chance to drastically cut resource usage during energy consumption, lower CO2 emissions, and provide 100 % fresh air circulation. © 2024 The Authors",10.1016/j.uncres.2024.100125,KeAi Communications Co.,0.0,Scopus,All-air HVAC system; Case study; Economic insights; Geothermal energy; Thermal modeling,Article,India,Science Advances
Predicting Motivation among GKP Recipients using Regression Techniques in Machine Learning: An Implementation of Rapid Miner,Razi N.F.M.; Sarkam N.A.; Mohammad N.H.; Azmi A.Z.; Wahab J.A.; Baharun N.H.,2025,"Recently, predictive analytics has found a place in many research areas. From business to healthcare, the revolutions of predictive analytics studies are constantly evolving to help decision makers identify the problem and make a wise decision. While a bigger impact has been reported on the development of predictive models in business studies, there has been very little effort that investigates the deployment of predictive models by using machine learning approaches specifically involving SMEs. Small business entrepreneurs (SMEs) are among the entities most affected because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, this study aims to develop a model that could predict the motivation score of GKP recipients based on three factors: satisfaction, perceived value, and perceived expectation. Four different regression models, namely Linear, Ridge, Lasso, and SVR, were developed and evaluated as the best model by using Rapid Miner machine learning software tools. The GKIPP grant dataset has been used as a case study for estimating the motive of the GKP grant to evaluate the outcomes of various regression models. The findings indicate that linear and SVR models have produced highly accurate predictions about the motivation of GKP recipients. They have also produced a high proportion of R-square scores across all regression models, which is highly encouraging. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

Home-based care and center-based care: From being alternatives to being synergistic. Optimization models to support flexible care delivery,Cappanera P.; Visintin F.; Vannelli S.,2025,"The delivery of health care services, especially for patients with chronic conditions and/or requiring cyclical treatment, can be accomplished by resorting to two organizational models: center-based care and home-based care. In developed countries, government pressure to reduce healthcare spending and the COVID-19 pandemic have led to the spread of home-based care. This type of care is proven to outperform the center-based one in terms of cost-effectiveness, patient satisfaction, and adherence to treatment guidelines. However, even for treatments usually suitable to be delivered at home, the patient's health status or other constraints may make it inappropriate to deliver service at the patient's home. This calls for a new organizational model, referred to as flexible care, where home-based and center-based care are not seen as mutually exclusive models but as options that can be activated according to the patient's and provider's needs. This paper presents a novel network-based deterministic optimization model and two matheuristics to address a scheduling problem typically faced by providers adopting a flexible care model. The model considers a provider relying on a treatment room with a fixed number of medical chairs, a fleet of vehicles, and a team of operators. It allows for determining on which days of the planning horizon, in which setting (home or center), and by which operator each patient will be treated. The model takes into account patients’ preferences and considers two objective functions: minimizing provider costs and patients’ travel time. In addition, we propose a two-stage mixed-integer stochastic programming model with recourse actions. This model allows incorporating the uncertainty due to the occurrence of adverse events. Adverse events are sudden changes in the patient's condition randomly happening at a specific point in the planning horizon. These events render the patient unsuitable for home care and require them to be visited at the center from that moment onward. The models have been inspired by a real case and tested on multiple random instances. © 2024 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.omega.2024.103184,Elsevier Ltd,0.0,Scopus,Flexible care; Health care; Home care; Matheuristics; Network optimization; Stochastic programming,Article,Chile,Computers & Education
"Examining the impact of learning motivation, desire to work, and curiosity of students in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era",Fikri M.; Zahri T.N.; Anggraini O.K.,2025,"This research aims to examine the influence of learning motivation based on environmental conditions, desire to work, and main desires. To achieve this, a quantitative research design was used, and a total of 500 students (101 boys and 399 girls) in Indonesia were selected as respondents using proportional random sampling techniques. Data collection was carried out using a learning motivation scale questionnaire. The results showed that students had a high level of motivation, with an average score of 50.8. The desire to work can be seen from hopes and dreams, as well as a conducive environment. It is known that external factors such as encouragement from others and involvement in activities have a greater influence with significance scores of 0.801 and 0.766 respectively. Meanwhile, appreciation and hopes or aspirations each received a score of 0.709 and 0.704. This implies that encouragement and activity can be integrated into the student's self. The research also shows that gender does not have a significant effect on the desire to learn. However, providing appropriate encouragement and rewards will increase students' willingness to learn, which can be maintained by educational institutions and parents and instill a desire for personal progress and development. © 2025, Intelektual Pustaka Media Utama.

Molecular Docking of Phytochemicals from M. Charantia Targeting SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease,Rozani N.H.A.; Tap F.M.; Majid F.A.A.; Mokhtar N.A.; Khairudin N.B.A.,2025,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a transmittable disease caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak of the disease has affected the world in a negative manner. The development and on-going vaccination efforts has reduced the mortality rate in people with existing comorbidities and lowered virus transmission rate. However, there are still the needs for prescribed medicines that can be consumed by COVID-19 infected persons. Momordica charantia L. has been used in traditional medicines to treat various diseases including anti-diabetic and cancer. Pharmacological studies on Momordica charantia L. revealed that the plant stored many useful phytoconstituents that might be exploited for producing drug compounds to treat COVID-19. Nowadays, computational-aided drug methods are widely used in drug discovery process as it requires minimal compound design and improve the development pipeline. In this study, molecular docking of five phytochemicals from Momordica charantia L. were carried out against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). The results obtained revealed that some of the phytochemicals showed a better dock score compared to the drug molnupiravir. Based on the dock score and the medicinal properties of each compound, it is suggested that these compounds can be further studied for potential drugs against COVID-19. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

Exploring Students’ Creativity Using STEAM-Based Reading Texts,Yulianti E.; Rahman N.F.A.; Rahmadani A.; Phang F.A.; Suwono H.,2025,"Creative thinking is one of the important skills required to face the 21st century challenges. However, students’ creativity assessment is challenging. Grounded on the paradigm that creativity is a tangible parameter, this study aims to explore students’ creative thinking skill via a reading-based creativity test. The test was developed by considering the creativity indicators defined by Paul Torrance, i.e., fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration. In this creativity test, the reading and the questions were designed to make students integrate their science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) knowledge. Based on the empirical validation, the creativity test had a reliability of 0.897, indicating that the test was reliable to measure students’ creativity. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the test was conducted online to 108 junior high school students in East Java, Indonesia. In general, the students achieved the highest level of creativity in terms of originality that gained average score of 3.63 (with scale 4.00). Meanwhile, they underperformed on the aspects of elaboration having average score of 2.40. There were 93 and 79 students who responded very well on the originality and fluency aspects, respectively. In contrast, respectively over 30% and 50% of students showed a lack of creativity on the aspect of flexibility and elaboration. These creativity assessment data are beneficial for educational stakeholders especially to increase the quality of teaching and learning related to STEAM education. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

Combating Student Disconnection in Higher Education Using Place-Based Pedagogy: Encouraging Its Use as a Transformative Learning Practice in Digital Classrooms,Whitmore C.,2025,"Students and faculty are struggling with malaise fueled by contemporary polycrises and the aftermath of higher education’s COVID-19 pivot to technology-mediated instruction. Feelings of disconnection and alienation interfere with learning and affect individual well-being. Although many students have physically returned to classrooms, it remains clear that online education, which predates the pandemic and expanded massively in 2020, is here to stay. This article attempts to answer the question, “how can education be ‘rooted’ in place when place itself is increasingly ephemeral, non-existent, or untethered to a geolocation?” This call to (teaching) action presents an argument for using place-based pedagogy adapted for the digital context to promote student connectedness, well-being, and engagement with curricular materials and describes strategies to incorporate place-based pedagogy-inspired materials and assignments in online classes across the curriculum. The practices described in this article can foster a place-based educational approach that supports learners’ connections to place and growth as citizens and scholars. © 2025 Common Ground Research Networks.

"Flavonoids as potential SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors: In vitro activity evaluation, molecular docking, 3D-QSAR investigation and synthesis",Ren S.; Liu X.; Huang Y.; Zhu C.; Zhu W.; Dong H.,2025,"The damage to public health posed by the COVID-19 epidemic remains non-negligible, and research into highly effective antiviral drugs is key to addressing the epidemic. The main protease (Mpro) is critical for SARS-CoV-2 replication and acts as an effective target for drug development. To date, many flavonoid compounds have been reported to exhibit inhibition of Mpro, and flavonoid structures are informative for the development of new inhibitors. In the present study, we first evaluated the ability of 35 flavonoid compounds to bind Mpro and found that the hydrophobic interaction generated between the benzene ring and the residues may be the main source of binding force. The in vitro inhibitory activity of these compounds was tested by the FRET method, and most of them showed significant inhibition of Mpro. Preliminary analysis revealed that the presence of the glycosidic group was detrimental to the activity of the compounds, in addition the position of the hydroxyl substituent had an effect on the activity of the compounds. Reliable and predictive CoMFA (q2 = 0.541, r2 = 0.998, SEE = 0.039) and CoMISA (q2 = 0.554, r2 = 0.999, SEE = 0.034) models were developed, and the compounds were analyzed by 3D-QSAR with modeled steric, electrostatic, hydrogen bond donor, and hydrophobic fields. A series of compounds were synthesized and characterized, which showed similar experimental and predicted activities, with the activity of 15d (IC50 = 0.74 ± 0.04 uM) exceeding that of the template molecule 15 (0.98 ± 0.13 uM). Subsequently, molecular docking revealed the binding mode of 15d to Mpro and verified the predictions of steric, hydrogen bond donor, and hydrophobic field. In conclusion, these findings provide ideas for subsequent structural studies of flavonoids that could be used in the development of flavonoid-type SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. © 2024",10.1016/j.molstruc.2024.140286,Elsevier B.V.,0.0,Scopus,3D-QSAR; COVID-19; Flavonoid; SARS-CoV-2 main protease,Article,USA,Nature Communications
A fractional order SIR model describing hesitancy to the COVID-19 vaccination,Caetano C.; Morgado L.; Lima P.; Hens N.; Nunes B.,2025,"This study introduces a SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model using fractional derivatives to assess the population's hesitancy to the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Portugal. Leveraging the framework developed by Angstmann [1], our approach incorporates fractional derivatives to best describe the nuanced dynamics of the vaccination process. We begin by examining the qualitative properties of the proposed model. To substantiate the inclusion of fractional derivatives, empirical data along with statistical criteria are applied. Numerical simulations are performed to compare both integer and fractional order models. An epidemiological interpretation for the fractional order of the model is provided, in the context of a vaccination campaign. © 2024 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.apnum.2024.10.001,Elsevier B.V.,0.0,Scopus,COVID-19; Fractional derivatives; SIR model; Vaccine hesitancy,Article,Spain,Journal of Computer Science
Fully automated unsupervised learning approach for thermal camera calibration and an accurate COVID-19 human temperature tracking,Al-Azzawi A.; Hussein M.K.,2025,"During the past three years, people have suffered greatly from what the World Health Organization called the emerging COVID-19. The world lacked the means and methods for early detection of this virus. Several traditional methods were used for detecting the virus, such as thermometers, remote thermal detection guns, and other conventional methods. Most of these systems monopolized making profits or selling their camera products, with prices for these cameras equipped with temperature detection systems exceeding three thousand dollars. An unsupervised model for real-time detection of thermal face skin temperature is proposed. Despite the scarcity and limited availability of thermal video data, we found and used a database created at Nazarbayev University in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan, which contains clips of thermal video and RGB video. The two different videos were calibrated, and the unity was measured by two metrics: SSIM and correlation. Four methods of registration were used to achieve perfect congruence, and congruence was also measured through the two previous metrics. The K-means method was then used to extract clusters, and functions for post-processing were built. The thermal face skin was extracted by multiplying the binary face mask with the thermal face, and the temperature of the face was calculated by taking the average values of the thermal face skin pixels and converting them from Fahrenheit to Celsius. Satisfactory results were obtained, with some temperatures detected within the normal range, others below the normal range, and others higher than this rate. © 2025 Malque Publishing.

Optimizing MFCC parameters for the automatic detection of respiratory diseases,Yan Y.; Simons S.O.; van Bemmel L.; Reinders L.G.; Franssen F.M.E.; Urovi V.,2025,"Voice signals originating from the respiratory tract are utilized as valuable acoustic biomarkers for the diagnosis and assessment of respiratory diseases. Among the employed acoustic features, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are widely used for automatic analysis, with MFCC extraction commonly relying on default parameters. However, no comprehensive study has systematically investigated the impact of MFCC extraction parameters on respiratory disease diagnosis. In this study, we address this gap by examining the effects of key parameters, namely the number of coefficients, frame length, and hop length between frames, on respiratory condition examination. Our investigation uses four datasets: the Cambridge COVID-19 Sound database, the Coswara dataset, the Saarbrücken Voice Disorders (SVD) database, and a TACTICAS dataset. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed as the classifier, given its widespread adoption and efficacy. Our findings indicate that the accuracy of MFCC decreases as hop length increases, and the optimal number of coefficients is observed to be approximately 30. The performance of MFCC varies with frame length across the datasets: for the COVID-19 datasets (Cambridge COVID-19 Sound database and Coswara dataset), performance declines with longer frame lengths, while for the SVD dataset, performance improves with increasing frame length (from 50 ms to 500 ms). Furthermore, we investigate the optimized combination of these parameters and observe substantial enhancements in accuracy. Compared to the worst combination, the SVM model achieves an accuracy of 81.1%, 80.6%, and 71.7%, with improvements of 19.6%, 16.10%, and 14.90% for the Cambridge COVID-19 Sound database, the Coswara dataset, and the SVD dataset respectively. To validate the generalization of these findings, we employ the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model as a validation model. Remarkably, the LSTM model also demonstrates improved accuracy of 14.12%, 10.10%, and 6.68% across the datasets when utilizing the optimal combination of parameters. The optimal parameters are validated using an external voice pathology dataset (TACTICAS dataset). The results demonstrate the generalization capabilities of the optimized parameters across various pathologies, machine-learning models, and languages. © 2024 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.apacoust.2024.110299,Elsevier Ltd,0.0,Scopus,Acoustic biomarkers; MFCC extraction parameters; Optimized parameters; Respiratory disease,Article,India,Journal of Computer Science
Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the treatment of acute cholangitis caused by choledocholithiasis: A single-center retrospective study in Japan,Hanatani J.-I.; Kitagawa K.; Tomooka F.; Asada S.; Mitoro A.; Fujinaga Y.; Nishimura N.; Sato S.; Shibamoto A.; Fujimoto Y.; Kubo T.; Iwai S.; Tsuji Y.; Namisaki T.; Akahane T.; Kaji K.; Tanaka M.; Koizumi A.; Yorioka N.; Matsuda T.; Masuda H.; Takami M.; Kikuchi M.; Kawanishi M.; Ohoka K.; Watanabe D.; Kawasaki A.; Yoshiji H.,2025,"Objectives: This study aimed to determine the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the treatment of acute cholangitis caused by choledocholithiasis. Methods: The Japanese government declared a state of emergency in April 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 309 patients who underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for acute cholangitis caused by choledocholithiasis between April 2017 and December 2022. Results: Patients were categorized into a pregroup (n = 134) and a postgroup (n = 175), depending on whether they were diagnosed before or after the state of emergency declaration. The total number of ERCP cases and the number of ERCP cases with endoscopic stone removals increased after the state of emergency declaration. Compared with the pregroup, the numbers of patients with performance status of 0–1 and surgically altered anatomy increased, whereas the numbers of patients taking oral antiplatelets or anticoagulants and those with cerebrovascular disease decreased in the postgroup. The number of single-stage endoscopic stone removals increased and hospital stays were significantly shorter in the postgroup. No differences in adverse event rates were detected between the two groups. Conclusions: Although our hospital provides tertiary care, the number of patients with cholangitis in good general condition and no underlying disease increased after the state of emergency declaration. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an increase in the number of single-stage endoscopic treatments and shortened hospital stays for patients with acute cholangitis caused by choledocholithiasis. No safety issues with ERCP were detected, even during the pandemic. © 2024 The Authors.

Stationary distribution of a stochastic generalized SIRI epidemic model with reinfection and relapse,Wang K.; Fan H.; Zhu Y.,2025,"In this paper, we propose and investigate the stochastic SIRI epidemic model with two generalized incidence rate functions. We firstly study the existence and uniqueness of the globally positive solution to the stochastic SIRI model with positive initial value. Then we obtain sufficient conditions for the extinction of the disease in the stochastic epidemic model, and find that the large noise can make the disease die out exponentially. Meanwhile, we obtain that the solution to the stochastic model has a unique stationary distribution when R0s˜ is greater than one. Our results show that the intensity of white noise can affect the dynamical behaviors of the model. Finally, we use numerical simulation to illustrate theoretical results, and apply both the stochastic and deterministic models to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic in Serbia. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.spl.2024.110279,Elsevier B.V.,0.0,Scopus,Generalized nonlinear incidence; SIRI model; Stationary distribution,Article,USA,Journal of Machine Learning Research
Bacteriocins future perspectives: Substitutes to antibiotics,Cheruvari A.; Kammara R.,2025,"Background: Antimicrobials are substances that either eradicate or inhibit the growth of microorganisms. The days of traditional antibiotics are over since their overuse has led to worldwide health and environmental issues. Thus, there is a need for novel antimicrobial proteins/peptides with improved properties over existing ones. The goal of microbiology research over the past ten years has been to identify, create, and market antimicrobials from benign microorganisms that are just as effective. The bioactive peptides or proteins, synthesized by probiotics and other beneficial microorganisms, are also referred to as postbiotics. The application of the recently created postbiotics is unrestricted in the food sector. Nisin and pediocin are two postbiotics that are widely used in the worldwide food sector. If successful, they could also be the best candidates to be therapeutic proteins that take the place of traditional antibiotics. Scope and approach: To gain a comprehensive understanding of today's postbiotic landscape, it's crucial to grasp the importance of bacteriocin and its diverse applications across various sectors such as food, heterologous expression, bioprocessing, and as a substitute for antibiotics. Key findings and conclusions: Peptides with antibacterial properties that are authorized for use in the food industry are known as bacteriocins. They are utilized in agriculture, the food industry, and other fields. Due to new restrictions, stronger antiviral treatments are among the novel antimicrobial drugs being researched. The potential application of bacteriocins in COVID-19 therapy is under investigation. Additionally, other alternatives such as plant-based chemicals, animal venoms, and bacteriophage therapy have also contributed to the development of antibiotic substitutes. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.foodcont.2024.110834,Elsevier Ltd,0.0,Scopus,Antimicrobials; Lactococcus; Nisin; Pediocin; Postbiotics; Probiotics,Review,Australia,PLOS ONE

Analysis of donor characteristics in a Tertiary Hospital Blood Center in Indonesia,Triyono T.; Pratiwi D.,2025,"Blood donors constitute the main component of blood transfusion system. Changes over time can affect the demographic characteristics of the blood donor population. Voluntary donors tend to be safer than replacement donors in terms of TTIs transmission risks. This study aims to analyze the characteristics of voluntary and replacement blood donors in Dr. Sardjito Hospital Blood Center. This retrospective study analyzed the data of whole blood donors from January 2017 to May 2020. The number of donations was calculated as cumulative number based on the donor data bases. Data were presented as median (minimum-maximum) and proportion. Analysis was conducted using the Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests. There were 54,152 blood donors during the study period, consisted of 47,525 (87.8%) voluntary donors and 6,627 (12.2%) replacement donors. Most of the donors were male, with higher proportion in replacement donors (p <0.001). Voluntary donors tended to be younger than replacement ones [30(17-77) years and 35(17-70) years, respectively] (p <0.001). Voluntary donors gave blood more frequently (p <0.001). The proportion of donation number in two groups showed significantly different (p <0.001). The most donated blood types were O, D positive. There was an increasing trend in the monthly number of bloods donated from 2017 to 2019, but a decreasing trend in 2020. The decrease of blood donation during 2020, may be related to COVID-19 pandemic. © 2025 by SPC.",10.48309/jmpcr.2025.466324.1319,Sami Publishing Company,0.0,Scopus,Blood donors; donor demography; replacement donors; voluntary donors,Article,UK,Computers & Education
"Environmental, climatic, socio-economic factors and non-pharmacological interventions: A comprehensive four-domain risk assessment of COVID-19 hospitalization and death in Northern Italy",Palandri L.; Rizzi C.; Vandelli V.; Filippini T.; Ghinoi A.; Carrozzi G.; Girolamo G.D.; Morlini I.; Coratza P.; Giovannetti E.; Russo M.; Soldati M.; Righi E.; Azzalini D.; Barbieri R.; Bechtold P.; Borsari L.; Creola G.; Ferrari A.; Ferrari D.; Ferrari E.; Fioretti E.; Gatti M.G.; Iacuzio L.; Iseppi R.; Lugli C.; Monti M.; Morciano M.,2025,"Introduction: Up to now, studies on environmental, climatic, socio-economic factors, and non-pharmacological interventions (NPI) show diverse associations, often contrasting, with COVID-19 spread or severity. Most studies used large-scale, aggregated data, with limited adjustment for individual factors, most of them focused on viral spread than severe outcomes. Moreover, evidence simultaneously evaluating variables belonging to different exposure domains is scarce, and none analysing their collective impact on an individual level. Methods: Our population-based retrospective cohort study aimed to assess the comprehensive role played by exposure variables belonging to four different domains, environmental, climatic, socio-economic, and non-pharmacological interventions (NPI), on individual COVID-19-related risk of hospitalization and death, analysing data from all patients (no. 68472) tested positive to a SARS-CoV-2 swab in Modena Province (Northern Italy) between February 2020 and August 2021. Using adjusted Cox proportional hazard models, we estimated the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, investigating dose-response relationships through restricted cubic spline modelling for hazard ratios. Results: Several significant associations emerged: long-term exposure to air pollutants (NO2, PM10, PM2.5) was linked to hospitalization risk in a complex way and showed an increased risk for death; while humidity was inversely associated; temperature showed a U-shaped risk; wind speed showed a linear association with both outcomes. Precipitation increased hospitalization risk but decreased mortality. Socio-economic and NPI indices showed clear linear associations, respectively negative and positive, with both outcomes. Conclusions: Our findings offer insights for evidence-based policy decisions, improving precision healthcare practices, and safeguarding public health in future pandemics. Refinement of pandemic response plans by healthcare authorities could benefit significantly. © 2024 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.ijheh.2024.114471,Elsevier GmbH,0.0,Scopus,Containment and health index; COVID-19 outcomes; Deprivation index; Environmental and climate factors; Italy; Restrictive measures,Article,Spain,ACM Transactions on Graphics

"Estimation of gaseous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and characteristics of atmospheric PAHs at a traffic site in Kanazawa, Japan",Zhang X.; Zhang H.; Wang Y.; Bai P.; Zhang L.; Toriba A.; Nagao S.; Suzuki N.; Honda M.; Wu Z.; Han C.; Hu M.; Tang N.,2025,"Size-fractionated particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM>2.5) was collected at a traffic site in Kanazawa, Japan in a seasonal sampling work in 2020. Nine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (4- to 6-ring PAHs) were determined in fine and coarse particles. The gas/particle partitioning coefficients (Kp) of the PAHs were calculated from the supercooled liquid vapour pressure and octanol-air partitioning coefficient based on the relationships obtained in previous traffic pollution-related studies. Gaseous PAHs were estimated by Kp and the concentrations of PM and particulate PAHs. The concentrations of total PAHs were 32.5, 320.1 and 5646.2 pg/m3 in the PM>2.5, PM2.5 and gas phases, respectively. Significant seasonal trends in PAHs were observed (particle phase: lowest in summer, gas phase: lowest in spring, particle and gas phase: lowest in spring). Compared to 2019, the total PAH concentrations (in particles) decreased in 2020, especially in spring and summer, which might be due to reduced traffic trips during the COVID-19 outbreak. The incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) calculated from the toxic equivalent concentrations relative to benzo[a]pyrene (BaPeq) was lower than the acceptable limit issued by the US Environmental Protection Agency, indicating a low cancer risk in long-term exposure to current PAH levels. It is notable that gaseous PAHs considerably contributed to BaPeq and ILCR (over 50%), which highlighted the significance of gaseous PAH monitoring for public health protection. This low-cost estimation method for gaseous PAHs can be expected to reliably and conveniently obtain PAH concentrations as a surrogate for traditional sampling in the future work. © 2023",10.1016/j.jes.2023.09.009,Chinese Academy of Sciences,1.0,Scopus,COVID-19; Exposure-response relationship; Gas-particle partitioning; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Traffic,Article,UK,PLOS ONE
"Synthesis, characterization, DFT and molecular docking study of an antiviral drug, the crystallized 6-methoxylated derivative of favipiravir, in the presence of an iron (III) Lewis acid.",Labidi A.; Aissa T.; Fliss O.; Bensegueni R.; Jebali S.; Zid M.F.; Latrous L.; Megriche A.,2025,"Few years ago, the COVID-19 infection, caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, presented a worldwide health pandemic that taken the life of millions of people. In this concern, Favipiravir (FAV) has attracted considerable attention as an effective antiviral drug against this disease. In this study, the favipiravir's derivative (3‑hydroxy-6-methoxypyrazine-2-carboxamide) was synthetized, in presence of iron (III), and fully characterized through various analytical techniques including single-XRay, IR, UV and 1H/13C NMR. The refinement show the exclusive existence of enol form in the solid state. In solution, UV and NMR data were used to highlight the tautomeric equilibrium of this molecule. Additionally, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations were achieved to estimate the chemical parameters, electronic affinity and molecular electrostatic potential of the compound. Mulliken atomic charges as well as the chemical reactivity descriptors were investigated. Finally, the two tautomer forms of synthetized derivative were docked on SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB: 6LU7) and spike receptor-binding domain (PDB: 7BZ5) to evaluate their binding affinity. The docking simulation studies was predicted that the two forms had high binding affinity the critical amino acids residues of the receptor. This affinity was attributed to the presence of several hydrogen bonds for both tautomer along with five different hydrophobic interactions with the enol form. These results conduct to conclude that the synthetized product could be an interest potential drug for that type of diseases. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.molstruc.2024.139920,Elsevier B.V.,0.0,Scopus,COVID-19; Favipiravir derivative; Lewis acid; Molecular docking; Single XRay,Article,Canada,ACM Transactions on Graphics
"Optimizing medical oxygen concentrators: Efficiency, flexibility, and patient-centric solutions",Ramezani K.; dehaj F.M.; Hosseinzadeh Hejazi S.A.,2025,"Medical oxygen concentrators (MOCs) play a vital role in providing oxygen therapy to patients with respiratory diseases. This paper offers a comprehensive evaluation of different adsorbents, including 13X, LiLSX, 5A, CaX, Ag-ETS-10, and AgLiLSX, utilized in MOCs. Process modeling and multi-objective optimization are conducted to assess the effectiveness of these adsorbents using the Skarstrøm cycle, employing pressure swing adsorption (PSA), vacuum swing adsorption (VSA), and pressure vacuum swing adsorption (PVSA) processes. The optimization result indicates that LiLSX is the top choice, providing medical-grade oxygen at a total product flow rate exceeding 15 SLPM. Additionally, 13X and CaX are identified as economical alternatives, particularly suitable for employment in the PSA and VSA processes, respectively. This study highlights the significance of establishing a connection between the Medical and Chemical Engineering communities through the direct incorporation of medical performance indicators, such as the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2), into the optimization process. The findings serve as a guide for selecting an appropriate design based on the patient's requirements and demonstrate LiLSX's capability to meet a diverse range of treatments, achieving FIO2 values up to 0.75. Furthermore, we explore the flexibility of MOC designs in meeting the demands of multiple patients simultaneously and propose energy-efficient design options based on patient needs. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into optimizing MOCs, ensuring effective and reliable oxygen therapy for patients, while also addressing challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic and potential global lithium scarcity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.seppur.2024.128549,Elsevier B.V.,0.0,Scopus,Material screening; Medical oxygen concentrator; Pressure swing adsorption; Process optimization,Article,Spain,Journal of Computer Science
Intelligent transportation system for automated medical services during pandemic,Singh A.K.; Pamula R.; Akhter N.; Battula S.K.; Naha R.; Chowdhury A.; Kaisar S.,2025,"Infectious viruses are spread during human-to-human contact and can cause worldwide pandemics. We have witnessed worldwide disasters during the COVID-19 pandemic because of infectious viruses, and these incidents often unfold in various phases and waves. During this pandemic, so many deaths have occurred worldwide that they cannot even be counted accurately. The biggest issue that comes to the forefront is that health workers going to treat patients suffering from COVID-19 also may get infected. Many health workers have lost their lives to COVID-19 and are still losing their lives. The situation can worsen further by coinciding with other natural disasters like cyclones, earthquakes, and tsunamis. In these situations, an intelligent automated model is needed to provide contactless medical services such as ambulance facilities and primary health tests. In this paper, we explore these types of services safely with the help of an intelligent automated transportation model using a vehicular delay-tolerant network. To solve the scenario, we propose an intelligent transportation system for automated medical services to prevent healthcare workers from becoming infected during testing and collecting health data by collaborating with a delay-tolerant network of vehicles in intelligent transport systems. The proposed model automatically categorizes and filters infected patients, providing medical facilities based on their illnesses. Our mathematical evaluation and simulation results affirm the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed model, highlighting its strength compared to existing state-of-the-art protocols. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.future.2024.107515,Elsevier B.V.,0.0,Scopus,Automation; Intelligent transportation system (ITS); Machine learning; Opportunistic network; Routing protocol; Smart medical service; Vehicular delay tolerant networks (VDTN),Article,India,Journal of Computer Science

We investigated whether a tidal volume ≥ 7 ml/kg PBW may be safe in COVID-19 patients, particularly those with compliance >50 mL/cmH2O. Materials and methods: This secondary analysis of a multicenter study compares the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality among 600 patients ventilated with <7 or ≥ 7 mL/kg PBW. Compliance was categorized as <40, 40–50, or > 50 mL/cmH2O. Results: 346 patients were ventilated with <7 (6.2 ± 0.5) mL/kg PBW and 254 with ≥7 (7.9 ± 0.9) mL/kg PBW. ICU mortality was 33 % and 29 % in the two groups (p = 0.272). At multivariable regression analysis, tidal volume ≥ 7 mL/kg PBW was associated with lower ICU mortality in the overall population (odds ratio: 0.62 [95 %-confidence interval: 0.40–0.95]) and in each compliance category. Conclusions: A tidal volume ≥ 7 (up to 9) mL/kg PBW was associated with lower ICU mortality in these COVID-19 patients, including those with compliance <40 mL/cmH2O. This finding should be interpreted cautiously due to the retrospective study design. Trial registration: ClinicalTrails.gov NCT04388670. © 2024",10.1016/j.jcrc.2024.154921,W.B.

Control of scabies fluctuation during COVID-19 pandemic,Abdullah; Ahmad S.; Albalawi W.; Omer N.,2025,"This study investigates the dynamics of scabies infestation using a mathematical model, analyzing its stability, sensitivity, and optimal control. We analyze the model for stability, and the results demonstrate the system's stable behavior under specific conditions, suggesting the possibility of effective control. The model is subjected to sensitivity analysis, revealing the most influential parameters affecting the infestation's dynamics. These parameters are identified as key targets for intervention. The optimal control strategy is derived using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, minimizing the cost of intervention while effectively controlling the infestation. The results demonstrate the importance of early intervention and sustained control efforts. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of scabies infestation dynamics, highlighting the critical factors influencing its spread and the most effective control strategies. The findings inform public health policy and guide resource allocation to combat scabies infestations effectively. The major contributions include improved understanding of scabies transmission dynamics, identification of critical parameters, development of evidence-based control strategies, evaluation of resource allocation effectiveness, and assessing intervention impact. It may also contribute to public health policy, resource allocation, disease surveillance, and intervention strategies.

Tourism forecasting by mixed-frequency machine learning,Hu M.; Li M.; Chen Y.; Liu H.,2025,"This study aims to establish the nonlinear relationship between high frequency Baidu search volumes, low frequency tourist arrivals and dummy variables and proposes a mixed-frequency machine learning model: the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Mixed Frequency Data Sampling (BiLSTM-MIDAS) model. The empirical results of forecasting weekly tourist arrivals to Kulangsu and Jiuzhaigou Valley in China demonstrate that (1) BiLSTM-MIDAS can outperform benchmark models, which is also confirmed during the COVID-19 pandemic period; (2) Compared with the MIDAS model, establishing the nonlinear relationship between high frequency Baidu search volumes, low frequency tourist arrivals and dummy variables using BiLSTM-MIDAS can improve the roles of high-frequency search engines in forecasting tourism demand.

"Adolescence, Interrupted: A narrative review of the impact of Covid-19 on adolescent wellbeing",Oakley E.; Vintges J.; Abu Hamad B.; Mitu K.; Seager J.; Yadete W.; Jones N.; Baird S.,2025,"The Covid-19 pandemic has had far-reaching impacts across the globe, with divergent experiences across the life course. Although mortality and morbidity effects have been disproportionately felt among older generations, there is growing recognition that adolescents have also faced multidimensional consequences, fueled by closure of schools and recreational spaces, and widespread disruption to services. While much has been written about the educational and health effects of the pandemic on adolescents, less attention has been given to other aspects of their wellbeing. This narrative review therefore summarizes the current evidence on the effects of the pandemic on adolescent wellbeing. We draw on the United Nations (UN) H6 + Technical Working Group on Adolescent Health and Well-being's conceptualization of adolescent wellbeing (Ross et al., 2020), focusing on three domains: connectedness, positive values and contribution to society; safety and a supportive environment; and agency and resilience. Drawing on both peer-reviewed and grey literature from high-, middle- and low-income contexts, we focused our search on adolescents (aged 10–19) and Covid-19 pandemic-related effects on wellbeing in these three domains. We also highlight findings related to three groups of adolescents who have often been overlooked in the literature on the impact of the pandemic: adolescent refugees, married adolescents, and adolescents with disabilities. We searched using Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus, as well as working paper series at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) and the World Bank, to identify published and grey literature across the three domains of interest. We restricted the search to articles that presented new, original data, included adolescents (aged 10–19), and were published in English, between January 1, 2020 and April 30, 2022. We expanded the search to make use of the bibliographies uncovered through this review to check for other citations that might meet the search criteria. The search yielded 193 articles on adolescent wellbeing in the three domains of interest during the Covid–19 pandemic. Adolescents in high-income countries (HICs) were overrepresented compared to those in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (126 vs. 60 articles). Furthermore, more articles focused on social connectedness (117 studies) than on adolescent wellbeing in terms of agency and resilience (73 studies) and safety and a supportive environment (61 studies). Nearly three years after the Covid-19 pandemic's onset, the literature on adolescent wellbeing highlights the multiple and intersecting challenges that adolescents faced, especially those living in LMICs. Service disruptions (notably school closures) combined with financial stress, heightened vulnerability to age- and gender-based violence, and social isolation placed unprecedented pressures on young people, taking a toll on their physical and mental health. Evidence that the pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities – with the most vulnerable adolescents (such as refugees, adolescents with disabilities and married girls) seemingly worst affected – is particularly salient for policy makers. While many adolescents are finding ways to cope (by relying on family and teacher support, connecting with peers through online networks or volunteering), understanding how to promote adolescent resilience more effectively – particularly in LMIC contexts – will be essential to ensure a rapid post-Covid-19 recovery. © 2024",10.1016/j.worlddev.2024.106786,Elsevier Ltd,0.0,Scopus,Adolescence; Agency; Covid-19; Resilience; Safety; Social-emotional development,Review,Spain,Science Advances
Modeling and analysis of a two-strain immuno-epidemiological model with reinfection,Wu H.; Zhao Y.; Xu X.; Lou J.,2025,"In this paper, we formulate a two-strain model with reinfection that combines immunological and epidemiological dynamics across scales, using the COVID-19 pandemic as a case study. Firstly, we conduct a qualitative analysis of both within-host and between-host models. For the within-host model, we prove the existence and stability of equilibria, and Hopf bifurcation occurs from the infection equilibrium with immune response. This implies that, under specific immune states, the virus within an infected individual may persist, and its concentration may also oscillate periodically. For the between-host model, the disease-free equilibrium always exists and is locally asymptotically stable when the epidemiological basic reproduction number ℜ0<1. In addition, the model can have boundary equilibria of strain 1 or strain 2, which are locally asymptotically stable under specific conditions. However, the co-existence equilibrium does not exist. Secondly, to explore the infection and transmission mechanisms of two strain models and obtain reliable parameter values, we utilize statistical data to fit the immuno-epidemiological model. Simultaneously, we conduct an identifiability analysis of the immuno-epidemiological model to ensure the robustness of the fitted parameters. The results demonstrate the reliable estimation of parameter ranges for structurally unidentifiable parameters with minor measurement errors using the affine invariant ensemble Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm (GWMCMC). Moreover, simulations illustrate that enhancing treatment of patients infected with BA.2 strains to inhibit the number of viruses released by infected cells can significantly reduce disease spread. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.nonrwa.2024.104188,Elsevier Ltd,0.0,Scopus,Between-host dynamics; Identifiability analysis; Immuno-epidemiology; Within-host dynamics,Article,Argentina,PLOS ONE
Variable neighborhood search approach to face-shield delivery during pandemic periods,Pacheco J.; Casado S.,2025,"In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and its rapid spread shook health authorities worldwide at the regional and national levels. Healthcare systems had difficulty acquiring important supplies, such as face shields, which at that time were essential for healthcare staff. The need for this material increased with the spread of the pandemic. In most areas, warehouses did not have a sufficient stock of this product. This situation has occurred in the cities and provinces of Burgos (Spain). Volunteers (citizens and small companies) owning three-dimensional printers offered themselves to manufacture face shields. These volunteers are called “makers.” Similarly, different organizations (mainly Civil Protection) took charge of transport activities (delivery of material to the makers, collection of face shields, and delivery of the latter to hospitals and other entities). In this study, we were tasked with developing a system for planning and rationalizing these activities. The problems that were solved included a vehicle routing problem with different characteristics compared with other models in the literature. A previuous work described this problem, and the heuristic method used for the planning. However, it is necessary to develop tools that are as efficient as possible for similar situations. In this study, we propose a mathematical formulation of the problem and a method based on the metaheuristic strategies variable neighborhood search and greedy randomize adaptative search procedure on a multistart framework. Different tests with real instances used during the period in which these activities were conducted show that the new method improves the results obtained by the previous method as well as the commercial software. © 2023 The Authors.

Advancement in SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis: A new and stable electrochemical biosensor for genomic RNA detection,Gomide J.A.L.; Moço A.C.R.; Tanaka L.T.R.; Alexandre M.R.A.; Roca T.P.; Vieira Dall'acqua D.S.; Costa Nunes Soares M.M.; Oliveira R.J.; Lima R.C.; Madurro J.M.; Brito-Madurro A.G.,2025,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, having already caused more than seven million deaths worldwide. Conventional techniques for SARS-CoV-2 detection have limitations, as high cost, low specificity, and longer analysis time, among others. Biosensors emerge as a necessary alternative to overcome the difficulties of current diagnostics. This paper reports a sensor platform where silver-doped zinc oxide nanomaterial (Ag:ZnONp) was used onto carbon screen-printed electrode and ethidium bromide as indicator for development of a specific electrochemical genosensor for COVID-19. This genosensor demonstrated good linearity between the concentrations of 5.62 × 104–5.62 copies/mL and a detection limit of 5 copies/mL with gRNA in patient's samples, with a response time within 30 min. Molecular modeling and morphological analysis are in agreement with obtained electrochemical results. Additional techniques such as AFM, SEM, and EIS were conducted to characterize the morphological and electrochemical properties of the biosensor's surface. The biosensor was also capable of detecting the target presence in spiked samples and demonstrated a stability of 60 days, higher than other similar biosensors for SARS-CoV-2. © 2024",10.1016/j.bioelechem.2024.108798,Elsevier B.V.,0.0,Scopus,Electrochemistry; Ethidium bromide; Genosensor; Point-of-care; SARS-CoV-2; Sensitivity,Article,Chile,ACM Transactions on Graphics
Modelling and Forecasting the COVID-19 Mortality Rates in Malaysia by using ARIMA Model,Nor S.R.M.; Samsudin N.S.; Manap M.A.; Norrulashikin S.M.,2025,"Over the last year, the COVID-19 epidemic has afflicted over 150 million individuals and killed over three million people globally. Various forecasting models attempted to estimate the temporal course of the COVID-19 pandemic during this time period in order to determine effectiveness of the government action in facing COVID-19 outbreak. In this study, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were used in order to forecast the COVID-19 mortality rates data in Malaysia. The accuracy of the ARIMA models is then evaluated by using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Absolute Error (RMSE). The forecasting model with the lowest error is picked as the best. In this study, ARIMA (1,1,3) outperformed the ARIMA (1,1,2) and ARIMA (1,1,4) models since it has the lowest MAE and RMSE values. However, as compared to ARIMA (1,1,4), the study found that ARIMA (1,1,3) model is not adequate in terms of model fitting due to the errors were not normally distributed. Hence, ARIMA (1,1,4) model was chosen to make prediction of COVID-19 mortality rates. Accordingly, the findings through this study can be used as a preliminary study to predict the COVID-19 mortality rates and other future pandemic cases to mitigate risk of increasing cases. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

"Synthesis, single crystal culture, activation energy calculation and HMBC spectrum of 1-methyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester and its positional isomers",Fan C.; Wu C.; Luan L.; Chen J.; Sun T.,2025,"Ensitrelvir is a 3CLpro inhibitor developed by SHIONOGI & CO., Ltd. of Japan for the treatment of COVID-19 and was approved for marketing in Japan on November 1, 2022. Various research results show that compared with Pfizer's Paxlovid and Merck's molnupiravir, Ensitrelvir is currently the most effective, safest and longest-lasting drug in the world! The synthesis of ensitrevir can be divided into four segments, and the docking of these four segments. Among them, the challenging segments are the triazole and indole segments due to the issue of methylation selectivity. In this study, DFT theory was primarily employed to investigate the activation energy of 1-methyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester and its positional isomers under different solvent conditions. Through experimental screening, selective methylation of 1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester was achieved. Subsequently, single crystals of the main product were cultivated, and calculations of electron density, nuclear magnetic resonance vibrations, etc., were performed for the three products to study the differences in the properties of various methylation products. Further structural confirmation of the three compounds was carried out using HMBC two-dimensional spectra. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.molstruc.2024.139208,Elsevier B.V.,0.0,Scopus,"COVID-19; Ensitrevir; Nsp5; Triazole, DFT",Article,Mexico,Nature Communications
The Implementation of Long-Short Term Memory for Tourism Industry in Malaysia,Taib S.A.T.; Abu N.; Senawi A.; Go C.K.,2025,"Across the world, tourism is known as the largest contributor towards economy and the fastest developing industry. It has the capability of generating income, creating job opportunities and help people to understand the culture diversity of other countries. Therefore, tourism demand forecasting is really needed to help the practitioners involved as well as government in pricing setting, in assessing future requirements of capacity to fulfil the customers’ demand or in making wise decisions on whether to explore new market or not. This study focuses on tourism demand forecasting based on the number of tourist arrival using recurrent neural network (RNN), which is long-short term memory (LSTM) model. The data used in this study is historical data of number of tourist arrivals in Malaysia before the onset of Movement Control Order (MCO) starting from January 2000 to February 2020 due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The data set was divided into two subsets, training and testing data sets based on ratio 80:20. The objective of this study is to determine an accurate forecasting model especially in tourism industry in Malaysia. The forecast evaluation implemented to predict the error of each model are Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the analyses for this model was performed by using Python software. Based on the results obtained, the LSTM model was considered as one of the accurate prediction methods for tourism demand in Malaysia due to the least error produced. It is hoped that these results can help the government as well as practitioners in tourism industry to make a right judgement and formulate better tourism plans in order to minimize any consequences in the future. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

Global Stock Markets during Covid-19: Did Rationality Prevail?,Talebi A.; Bragues G.; Hadlul S.; Sharma A.,2025,"This study assesses the validity of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH) during the Covid-19 period by evaluating whether various stock markets around the world accurately predicted economic performance in their respective countries. The underlying premise is that stock prices should discount future company cash flows, and the projection of these cash flows can be proxied by investors' ability to forecast macroeconomic conditions. We assess stock market performance from January 2020 to February 2022 in 16 countries, equally split between developed and emerging markets. While results varied, the study suggests that stock markets generally predicted economic activity during Covid-19. The modeling test indicated that stock markets significantly predicted economic activity in 11 out of 16 countries, particularly in developed markets. Furthermore, incorporating the stock market as a variable, improved economic forecasts in all 16 countries. Unlike other studies that mainly focused on the characteristics of share price movements, this research judges the rationality of stock markets against an external criterion. Ultimately, it suggests that EMH was mostly vindicated during the Covid-19 period. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.ribaf.2024.102610,Elsevier Ltd,0.0,Scopus,Covid-19; Economic Tracker; Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH); OECD countries,Article,Canada,Nature Communications
The relationship between microRNAs and COVID-19 complications,Kebriaei A.; Besharati R.; Namdar Ahmad Abad H.; Havakhah S.; Khosrojerdi M.; Azimian A.,2025,"Over the past three years, since the onset of COVID-19, several scientific studies have concentrated on understanding susceptibility to the virus, the progression of the illness, and possible long-term complexity. COVID-19 is broadly recognized with effects on multiple systems in the body, and various factors related to society, medicine, and genetics/epigenetics may contribute to the intensity and results of the disease. Additionally, a SARS-CoV-2 infection can activate pathological activities and expedite the emergence of existing health issues into clinical problems. Forming easily accessible, distinctive, and permeable biomarkers is essential for categorizing patients, preventing the disease, predicting its course, and tailoring treatments for COVID-19 individually. One promising candidate for such biomarkers is microRNAs, which could serve various purposes in understanding diverse forms of COVID-19, including susceptibility, intensity, disease progression, outcomes, and potential therapeutic options. This review provides an overview of the most significant findings related to the involvement of microRNAs in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Furthermore, it explores the function of microRNAs in a broad span of effects that may arise from accompanying or underlying health status. It underscores the value of comprehending how diverse conditions, such as neurological disorders, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and obesity, interact with COVID-19. © 2024 The Authors",10.1016/j.ncrna.2024.08.007,KeAi Communications Co.,0.0,Scopus,COVID-19; Diabetes; Heart disease; microRNA; Neurological disease; Obesity,Review,Japan,Journal of Machine Learning Research
Cognitive function and brain structure in COVID-19 survivors: The role of persistent symptoms,Vakani K.; Norbury R.; Vanova M.; Ratto M.; Parton A.; Antonova E.; Kumari V.,2025,"Persistent COVID-19 symptoms post-acute state have been shown to have a significant negative impact on brain structure and function. In this study, we conducted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the whole brain in 43 working-age adults (mean age: 44.79±10.80; range: 24–65 years) with a history of COVID-19 (731.17±312.41 days post-diagnosis), and also assessed their cognitive function (processing speed, attention, working memory, executive function, and recognition memory), mental health, and sleep quality. MRI data were processed using FSL to derive regional volumes for bilateral nucleus accumbens, caudate, pallidum, putamen, thalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus, and total grey matter, white matter, and cerebral spinal fluid volume, and analysed in relation to persistent COVID-19 symptom load, mental health, and sleep quality. Higher persistent COVID-19 symptom load was significantly associated with smaller putamen volume, lower response accuracy on working memory, executive function, and recognition memory tasks, as well as a longer time to complete the executive function task, and poorer mental health and sleep quality. Smaller putamen fully mediated the relationship between persistent COVID-19 symptom load and lower executive function. Further research is required to confirm whether reduced putamen volume and its association with poor executive function persists in COVID-19 survivors in the long term. © 2024 The Authors",10.1016/j.bbr.2024.115283,Elsevier B.V.,0.0,Scopus,Brain fog; Executive function; Mediation; Mild cognitive problems; Putamen; SARS-CoV-2,Article,Chile,Computers & Education
"Stress, Depression, Public Stigma, and Their Associated Factors Among University Students in Thailand After the COVID-19 Pandemic",Siewchaisakul P.; Sirikarn P.; Phimha S.; Narom N.; Singweratham N.; Yimcharoen M.; Boonchieng W.; Longkul J.; Wungrath J.,2025,"University students have been faced with challenges, including COVID-19 public stigma, which results in increased stress and depression. Few studies have assessed stress, depression, and public stigma of COVID-19 after the pandemic. This paper investigated stress, depression, and public stigma of COVID-19 among Thai University students. A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online questionnaire to assess stress, depression, and public stigma resulting from COVID-19 among Thai university students between 15 and 30 August 2022. The questionnaire was developed by the Department of Mental Health, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand. Public stigma was measured by the COVID-19 public stigma scale. The effects of public COVID-19 stigma on stress and depression were analyzed using multivariable multi-level logistic regression. A total of 2, 422 students completed the questionnaire. After multivariable analysis adjustment, students who experienced COVID-19 public stigma showed increased stress (AOR = 1.53; 95% CI [1.27–1.84]) and depression levels (AOR = 1.34; 95% CI [1.01–1.79]). Those who lived with high-risk COVID-19 individuals showed significant risk factors for stress, depression, and public stigma of COVID-19, while income presented the reverse effect. Those vaccinated with over two doses showed significantly reduced chances of depression. The COVID-19 public stigma plays a vital role in stress and depression levels among Thai university students. To mitigate stress and depression, an evaluation of public stigma is needed even after the pandemic. Further cohort studies are required to verify long-term results. © (2025), (Journal of Population and Social Studies).

Health Care Utilisation in a Cohort of Patients with Primary and Secondary Antibody Deficiency in the United Kingdom,Dimbleby B.; Greenway W.; Burns S.O.; Richter A.G.; Shields A.M.,2025,"Introduction: This study investigates the frequency of hospital attendances, emergency care attendances and geographical influences on service interaction in cohorts of patients with primary and secondary antibody deficiency, to inform future service planning and delivery. Methods: The COVID-19 in Antibody Deficiency (COV-AD) study was a United Kingdom study that enrolled 525 participants between April 2021 and September 2022. Data on health care utilisation was extracted from a screening cohort of participants at one participating site (Birmingham, UK). Hospital attendance (i.e. all outpatient and inpatient care episodes, including hospital-based IVIG treatment) and emergency care attendance patterns were analysed. Geographical differences in travel times to hospitals and associated costs were considered for all participants at all recruiting sites. Results: Individuals with antibody deficiency had a median of 7 hospital attendances per year. A diagnosis of secondary antibody deficiency, and antibody deficiency severe enough to require treatment with immunoglobulin replacement were associated with an increased frequency of hospital attendance. 12.7% of the cohort attended the Emergency Department at least once in the preceding twelve months. Individuals with secondary antibody deficiency were at greater risk of requiring emergency care over the preceding one-year and five-year periods. Individuals receiving subcutaneous immunoglobulin lived further from their local immunology centre and were more likely to engage with the COV-AD research study remotely, via dried blood spots sampling. Conclusion: This study highlights the utilisation of emergency and secondary care usage amongst patient with immunodeficiency and may inform service adaptation and development to better accommodate patient needs and circumstances. © The Author(s) 2024.",10.1007/s10875-024-01809-3,Springer,0.0,Scopus,Healthcare Resource use; Inborn Errors of Immunity; Primary Immunodeficiency; Rare Disease; Secondary Immunodeficiency,Article,UK,Computers & Education
Nonlinear mixed models and related approaches in infectious disease modeling: A systematic and critical review,Adéoti O.M.; Agbla S.; Diop A.; Glèlè Kakaï R.,2025,"The level of surveillance and preparedness against epidemics varies across countries, resulting in different responses to outbreaks. When conducting an in-depth analysis of microinfection dynamics, one must account for the substantial heterogeneity across countries. However, many commonly used statistical model specifications lack the flexibility needed for sound and accurate analysis and prediction in such contexts. Nonlinear mixed effects models (NLMMs) constitute a specific statistical tool that can overcome these significant challenges. While compartmental models are well-established in infectious disease modeling and have seen significant advancements, Nonlinear Mixed Models (NLMMs) offer a flexible approach for handling heterogeneous and unbalanced repeated measures data, often with less computational effort than some individual-level compartmental modeling techniques. This study provides an overview of their current use and offers a solid foundation for developing guidelines that may help improve their implementation in real-world situations. Relevant scientific databases in the Research4life Access initiative programs were used to search for papers dealing with key aspects of NLMMs in infectious disease modeling (IDM). From an initial list of 3641 papers, 124 were finally included and used for this systematic and critical review spanning the last two decades, following the PRISMA guidelines. NLMMs have evolved rapidly in the last decade, especially in IDM, with most publications dating from 2017 to 2021 (83.33%). The routine use of normality assumption appeared inappropriate for IDM, leading to a wealth of literature on NLMMs with non-normal errors and random effects under various estimation methods. We noticed that NLMMs have attracted much attention for the latest known epidemics worldwide (COVID-19, Ebola, Dengue and Lassa) with the robustness and reliability of relaxed propositions of the normality assumption. A case study of the application of COVID-19 data helped to highlight NLMMs’ performance in modeling infectious diseases. Out of this study, estimation methods, assumptions, and random terms specification in NLMMs are key aspects requiring particular attention for their application in IDM. © 2024 The Authors",10.1016/j.idm.2024.09.001,KeAi Communications Co.,0.0,Scopus,Comparison; Epidemic; Heterogeneous data; Multilevel nonlinear models; PRISMA,Review,Italy,Journal of Machine Learning Research
Designing a new sustainable healthcare network considering the COVID-19 pandemic: Artificial intelligence-based solutions,Hajipour Machiani N.; Taleizadeh A.A.; Toloo M.; Abedsoltan H.,2025,"The COVID-19 pandemic, which is still spreading its new mutations all around the world, is considered a healthcare challenge around the world. The best approach to forestall this pandemic is to avoid exposure to the virus. Therefore, medical protective equipment is essential for fighting this pandemic. This underlines the chief role of having a sustainable supply chain network (SCN) for producing and distributing personal protective equipment to avoid shortage and augmenting costs. The reality, however, is that the COVID-19 pandemic leads to many developments in countries and this study is another step for these purposes. This research develops a multi-period, multi-objective, multi-echelon, and multi-product medical protective equipment sustainable SCN considering the production, distribution, allocation, and inventory with “risk pooling” strategy effect with the aim of filling the existing gaps in health SCN research during the COVID-19 pandemic. By applying the risk pooling strategy, lower inventory levels or higher service levels can be achieved without increasing inventory costs. This model explores the possibility of lateral transshipments between distribution centers, as a way to increase the reliability of SCN performance. We model a new production, inventory, distribution, location, and allocation problem and consider four objectives for our suggested model (i) minimizing total SCN costs, (ii) minimizing environmental effects, (iii) minimizing social impacts, and (iv) maximizing the reliability of demand delivery. The proposed model simultaneously examines all three dimensions of sustainability (economic, environmental, and social) as well as the reliability of demand delivery. Considering all of these decisions and assumptions brings the studied problem closer to reality. We employ various algorithms for solving our developed model with different sizes: the improved version of the augmented ε-constraint (AUGMECON2) algorithm for small and medium-sized problems and two meta-heuristic algorithms, i.e., Multi-Objective Whale Optimization Algorithm (MOWOA) and Multi-Objective Variable Neighborhood Search (MOVNS) algorithm, for large-sized ones. The Taguchi approach is used to tune the parameters of meta-heuristic algorithms, and a comparison is performed using four evaluation metrics: Mean Ideal Distance (MID), Number of Pareto Solutions (NPS), Maximum Spread (MS), and Spread of Non-Dominance Solution (SNS). Proposed solving methods for the studied problem and making comparisons between them are another innovation of this study. A couple of numerical examples are provided to illustrate the applicability of the presented solution methods. Finally, sensitivity analysis for problem parameters is performed to validate our suggested model. Our study reveals the superiority of the MOWOA over the other algorithms. © 2024 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.eswa.2024.125357,Elsevier Ltd,0.0,Scopus,COVID-19; Metaheuristics; Reliability; Sustainable healthcare network,Article,Spain,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
Sewer transport conditions and their role in the decay of endogenous SARS-CoV-2 and pepper mild mottle virus from source to collection,Mercier É.; D'Aoust P.M.; Eid W.; Hegazy N.; Kabir P.; Wan S.; Pisharody L.; Renouf E.; Stephenson S.; Graber T.E.; MacKenzie A.E.; Delatolla R.,2025,"This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the decay patterns of endogenous SARS-CoV-2 and Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) within wastewaters spiked with stool from infected patients expressing COVID-19 symptoms, and hence explores the decay of endogenous SARS-CoV-2 and PMMoV targets in wastewaters from source to collection of the sample. Stool samples from infected patients were used as endogenous viral material to more accurately mirror real-world decay processes compared to more traditionally used lab-propagated spike-ins. As such, this study includes data on early decay stages of endogenous viral targets in wastewaters that are typically overlooked when performing decay studies on wastewaters harvested from wastewater treatment plants that contain already-degraded endogenous material. The two distinct sewer transport conditions of dynamic suspended sewer transport and bed and near-bed sewer transport were simulated in this study at temperatures of 4 °C, 12 °C and 20 °C to elucidate decay under these two dominant transport conditions within wastewater infrastructure. The dynamic suspended sewer transport was simulated over 35 h, representing typical flow conditions, whereas bed and near-bed transport extended to 60 days to reflect the prolonged settling of solids in sewer systems during reduced flow periods. In dynamic suspended sewer transport, no decay was observed for SARS-CoV-2, PMMoV, or total RNA over the 35-h period, and temperature ranging from 4 °C to 20 °C had no noticeable effect. Conversely, experiments simulating bed and near-bed transport conditions revealed significant decreases in SARS-CoV-2 and total RNA concentrations by day 2, and PMMoV concentrations by day 3. Only PMMoV exhibited a clear trend of increasing decay constant with higher temperatures, suggesting that while temperature influences decay dynamics, its impact may be less significant than previously assumed, particularly for endogenous RNA that is bound to dissolved organic matter in wastewater. First order decay models were inadequate for accurately fitting decay curves of SARS-CoV-2, PMMoV, and total RNA in bed and near-bed transport conditions. F-tests confirmed the superior fit of the two-phase decay model compared to first order decay models across temperatures of 4 °C–20 °C. Finally, and most importantly, total RNA normalization emerged as an appropriate approach for correcting the time decay of SARS-CoV-2 exposed to bed and near-bed transport conditions. These findings highlight the importance of considering decay from the point of entry in the sewers, sewer transport conditions, and normalization strategies when assessing and modelling the impact of viral decay rates in wastewater systems. This study also emphasizes the need for ongoing research into the diverse and multifaceted factors that influence these decay rates, which is crucial for accurate public health monitoring and response strategies. © 2024",10.1016/j.ijheh.2024.114477,Elsevier GmbH,0.0,Scopus,Bed transport; Decay rate; Degradation testing; Persistence testing; Stool spike-in; Wastewater-based surveillance,Article,Japan,Science Advances
Robust Segmentation of COVID-19 Chest X-Ray Images: Analysis of Variant k-Means Based Clustering Algorithms,Herng O.W.; Nasir A.S.A.; Sukor A.S.A.,2025,"Computer aided diagnosis (CADx) become one the most famous method in diagnostic medical field due to the high reliability and efficiency. Recently, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become severe global pandemic. Particularly, the Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging has become an essentiality in COVID-19 detection. As a result, the convergence of CADx technology with Chest X-ray analysis has achieved great efficiency in COVID-19 diagnosis. Therefore, the research value of CADx in COVID-19 diagnosis is exceptionally high. This study aims to evaluate different k-means based clustering algorithms and identifying the one with the highest overall accuracy. First of all, 150 COVID-19 CXR open-source images are acquired from Kaggle and Github. All the images will be unified into a same image size with 1000*1000 pixels and quality during the image pre-processing. Next, the resized images are enhanced by the Modified Global Contrast Stretching (MGCS) enhancement method to increase the quality of images. Then, the traditional k-means, k-medians, k-medoids and fast k-means clustering methods have been implemented in the image segmentation. At the same time, five different numbers <2, 4, 6, 8, 10> of clusters also tested out in this study. Lastly, all the segmented is proceeded to the segmentation performance based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, recall and F-score. The result proves that the k-medoids clustering algorithm with 2 clusters archived the best overall segmentation performance as it obtained the highest sensitivity, accuracy, recall and F-score with 66.14%, 87.98%, 0.6614 and 0.7327. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

Information flow between stock returns of advanced markets and emerging African economies,Atipaga U.-F.; Alagidede I.; Tweneboah G.,2025,"This article used transfer entropy techniques to examine information flows of daily stock market returns between advanced markets and emerging African economies. We modelled the information transfers across different periods of global shocks – the Federal Reserve Bank normalisation post the Global Financial Crisis, oil price shocks, BREXIT, the U.S.-China trade war, and COVID-19. Information interactions from advanced to African markets were moderate, occasionally mixed, and insignificant, leaving room for portfolio diversification. We also discovered some progress regarding the integration process between the developed and African markets on the back of noticeable information exchanges. Our findings from the information exchanges indicate that the stock markets of South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, and Kenya have led the integration process ahead of their peers. To robust-check our results, we employed the wavelet multiple correlation (WMC) technique by modelling the multi-structure relationship among all the stock markets and confirmed the fast integration between the South African stock market and the developed markets. Our WMC results also revealed that portfolio diversification opportunities are feasible in the short term. The results present important implications for optimal risk management strategies and policy measures to anchor markets to withstand shocks. © 2024 The Authors",10.1016/j.ribaf.2024.102603,Elsevier Ltd,0.0,Scopus,Advanced markets; African stocks; Entropy; Information transfer,Article,Brazil,Science Advances
The Impact of Sensory Branding and Technology on Consumer Behavior in Physical Retail Experience Design: A Multi-generational Experimental Study,Tonin P.E.H.; Nickel E.M.; dos Santos F.A.V.,2025,"The COVID-19 pandemic transformed shopping habits and led to the need to rethink the experience offered in physical stores, incorporating solutions that involve, for instance, sensory branding and technology. How can these solutions influence cognitive processes and responses, leading to positive results for brands and their customers? The research seeks to answer the question through a qualitative experimental research, bringing together participants from different generations in order to provide an inclusive overview of user behavior when faced with these solutions. The sample of twenty-five volunteers was distributed equally into five different groups or generations: Silent Generation, Baby Boomers, Generation X, Generation Y, and Generation Z. With the aim of understanding and tracing experience through the users’ perspective, the experiments included a questionnaire and focus group session, which included the application of complementary techniques, as the Experience Compelling Map, to ensure greater reliability in results. Through this study, a general and inclusive overlook of consumer behavior was obtained as well as an integrated overview of the topic, providing a better understanding for both non-specialists and specialists and contributing to Design practice. The results were compared and generated fourteen guidelines that can become alternatives to enhance physical retail experience. © 2025 Common Ground Research Networks.

The effect of disruptive change on the spatial variation of commercial rental prices: The case of the COVID-19 pandemic,Cano-Guervos R.; Chica-Olmo J.; Chica-Garcia J.,2025,"This study examines spatial variations in the rental price of commercial premises and the factors that explain these variations in the event of a disruptive change such as the COVID-19 pandemic. A novelty of this work is the methodology used to determine the form and radius of influence on these prices (monotonically decreasing buffer with threshold) of heritage monuments as tourist attractions. The methodology is applied to a case study of the city of Granada, Spain, although it could be extrapolated to other cities displaying similar characteristics. The results indicate that commercial rental prices varied in a non-uniform manner throughout the city during the COVID-19 pandemic and that the main streets and prime locations were the most affected.

A compartmental model for the dynamic simulation of pandemics with a multi-phase vaccination and its application to Italian COVID-19 data,Cerqueti R.; Ramponi A.; Scarlatti S.,2025,"We introduce a generalization of the 4 compartments SVIR epidemic model discussed in [1] for the first time. Our model has K+4 compartments. K-1 of these compartments represent additional subsequent vaccination stages not considered in the original SVIR model, while a further compartment accounts for dead people. We analyze the equilibrium points of the model. A time-varying parameters version of it, having K=3 vaccination compartments, is then calibrated to Italian COVID-19 dataset. This analysis is carried out for three specific sub-periods: the first one, ranging from February 24th, 2020, up to December 26th 2020, when no vaccines were available; the second one, from the December 27th, 2020 up to December 31st, 2021, during which the Delta variant of the virus prevailed and Delta-targeted vaccination doses were administered to the population for the first time; finally, the last considered period is ranging from January 10th, 2022 up to June 3rd, 2022, and it was characterized by the diffusion of the Omicron variant. To tackle the problem of undetected infected or undetected recovered people we adopt an approach relying on different scenarios. The calibration of the model uses the property that the discrete-time version of it turns out to be explicitly solvable with respect to the parameters, hence providing a daily estimate of the involved parameters. This produces meaningful evolution patterns of the COVID-19 epidemic which allow a better understanding of the diffusive behavior of the pandemic along time. Lastly a statistical analysis of the epidemiological parameters estimators supports the non stationarity of their time series. © 2024 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.matcom.2024.08.011,Elsevier B.V.,0.0,Scopus,Compartmental epidemic models; Covid-19; Dynamic simulations; Equilibrium states,Article,India,ACM Transactions on Graphics

The Global Warming Impact Evaluation of Public Transportation During the COVID-19 Pandemic Using the Life Cycle Assessment Approach,Rahman A.; Noviarini C.; Suryawan I.W.K.; Septiariva I.Y.,2025,"The transportation industry plays an integral role in the daily lives of Indonesians. However, it also contributes to environmental degradation, particularly in terms of air quality, which impacts public health. This research applies the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method, a sustainability matrix, to gauge the environmental impact of Jakarta's public transportation system. Our study aims to identify car emissions and understand the environmental consequences they pose. The research was scoped to examine both the raw materials and energy input and the resultant emissions. Specifically, we analyzed the electricity consumption of Jakarta's MRT, Bus Trans Jakarta, and online taxi services. We utilized the LCA methodology and the SimaPro 9.1 software for assessment. Prior research data were incorporated to enhance the accuracy of our LCA model. A notable observation is the decline in public transportation usership since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Current health protocols allow only half the usual passenger capacity, compounded by a sluggish economy. Our findings reveal that the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT)'s CO2 emissions, at 0.019 kg/passenger/kilometer, are significantly lower than that of the BRT at 0.036 kg/passenger/kilometer. One recommendation to further reduce emissions is to transition buses from diesel to compressed natural gas (CNG) fuel. However, public adoption of these changes will largely hinge on individual preferences. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

Planning and adjusting the COVID-19 booster vaccination campaign to reduce disease burden,Di Domenico L.; Goldberg Y.; Colizza V.,2025,"As public health policies shifted in 2023 from emergency response to long-term COVID-19 disease management, immunization programs started to face the challenge of formulating routine booster campaigns in a still highly uncertain seasonal behavior of the COVID-19 epidemic. Mathematical models assessing past booster campaigns and integrating knowledge on waning of immunity can help better inform current and future vaccination programs. Focusing on the first booster campaign in the 2021/2022 winter in France, we used a multi-strain age-stratified transmission model to assess the effectiveness of the observed booster vaccination in controlling the succession of Delta, Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 waves. We explored counterfactual scenarios altering the eligibility criteria and inter-dose delay. Our study showed that the success of the immunization program in curtailing the Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 waves was largely dependent on the inclusion of adults among the eligible groups, and was highly sensitive to the inter-dose delay, which was changed over time. Shortening or prolonging this delay, even by only one month, would have required substantial social distancing interventions to curtail the hospitalization peak. Also, the time window for adjusting the delay was very short. Our findings highlight the importance of readiness and adaptation in the formulation of routine booster campaign in the current level of epidemiological uncertainty. © 2024 The Authors",10.1016/j.idm.2024.09.002,KeAi Communications Co.,0.0,Scopus,Age-structured model; COVID-19; Immunity waning; Inter-dose delay; Vaccination strategies,Article,France,Science Advances
"ShaShen-MaiDong decoction attenuates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting TGF-β/smad3, AKT/MAPK, and YAP/TAZ pathways",Huang L.; Yang X.; Feng Y.; Huang H.-X.; Hu J.-Q.; Yan P.-Y.; Pan H.-D.; Xie Y.,2025,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is progressive and terminal lung disease, which is also the most common sequelae of Corona Virus Disease (2019) (COVID-19) survivors. Unfortunately, there is currently no cure for PF. ShaShen-MaiDong decoction (SMT), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been employed in treating various lung diseases, which may offer potential therapeutic benefits for PF. Aim of the study: To investigate the antifibrotic efficacy of SMT and its major active ingredients as well as the underlying mechanisms for treating PF. Materials and methods: Fist, we build the UPLC-MS based qualitative and quantitative profiling for the quality control of SMT. Then, the antifibrotic efficacy of SMT was investigated in bleomycin (BLM)-induced PF mice model. Network pharmacology was used to predict the mechanism and active components of SMT for the treatment of PF, which was further verified in vitro and in vivo. Results: SMT improved the weight loss and attenuated hydroxyproline, inflammatory cytokines, and collagen deposition in BLM-induced PF mice model in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, as predicted by network pharmacology analysis, SMT and its active compounds (kaempferol, quercetin, and isorhamnetin) regulated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, and YAP/TAZ signaling pathway, which was further verified in the PF mice and TGF-β-induced A549 cell model. Moreover, SMT balanced the proportions of increased CD4+ and decreased CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of PF mice model. Conclusions: Considering the high mortality and complex pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases, our results provide novel evidence that SMT would be beneficial for pulmonary fibrosis therapy by modulating MAPK, TGF-β/Smad, and YAP/TAZ signaling pathways at same time. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.jep.2024.118755,Elsevier Ireland Ltd,1.0,Scopus,Active ingredients; MAPK; Pulmonary fibrosis; ShaShen-MaiDong decoction; TGF-β/Smad; YAP/TAZ,Article,Chile,ACM Transactions on Graphics
Motivation measurement of science student towards grouping e-learning,Abai D.S.A.; Hamli H.,2025,"During the two-year COVID-19 pandemic, lecturers must train themselves with information technology, assessment, and teaching expertise in order to move from face-to-face learning to virtual online learning. As a result, the current study aims to investigate the effect of student motivation on grouping e-learning in the ethics and civilization course. A total of 88 students from agriculture, fishing, and forestry were chosen to participate in the experiment. Students participated in online synchronous lectures for seven weeks and another seven weeks in online group presentations. After 14 weeks, students were given the attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction (ARCS) motivation model questionnaire to assess their motivation on the course. As a result, the ARCS questionnaire score was 4.62, indicating that student learning motivation was adequate. Furthermore, forestry students outperformed agricultural and fishery students in terms of ARCS model score. Male students who participated in the online grouping presentation had the greatest ARCS model score compared to female students.

Computational Thinking for Self-Regulated Learning,"Pasterk, Stefan and Benke, Gertraud",2024,"In this theoretical paper, we compare computational thinking and self-regulated learning. Many studies use self-regulated learning to foster the acquisition of computational thinking competencies. Self-regulated learning skills are themselves beneficial for any learning process; here, we argue that the relationship between self-regulated learning and computational thinking is closer than the simple observation that self-regulated learning strategies support the acquisition of computational thinking competencies. We sustain that self-regulated learning and computational thinking competencies share many features (and have some differences), which would support synergistic effects so that not only can self-regulated learning be used to attain computational thinking competencies, but computational thinking activities can also be used to foster features of self-regulated learning competencies.",10.1145/3649217.3653565,Association for Computing Machinery,74.0,ACM,,Research Article,Germany,Journal of Computer Science

Professional Development in Computational Thinking: A Systematic Literature Review,"Espinal, Alejandro and Vieira, Camilo and Magana, Alejandra J.",2024,"This paper presents a systematic literature review of professional development programs in computational thinking (CT). CT has emerged as an essential set of skills that everyone should develop to participate in a global society. However, there were no pre-service or in-service teacher programs to integrate CT into the K–12 classrooms until very recently. Thus, it is important to identify how educators and researchers address the challenges to prepare the next generation of students and what gaps persist in the current literature. We review existing work in this field from two perspectives: First, we analyze the learning outcomes, assessment methods, pedagogical approaches, and pedagogical tools used in the professional development programs in CT. Second, we examine how these programs assess the teachers’ knowledge and skills as outcomes. We used the technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) framework to characterize existing literature and identify possible gaps in the preparation of pre-service and in-service teachers in CT. Our results suggest that (1) existing evidence is limited to developed countries; (2) many studies are only focusing on teachers understanding the concepts but do not explore how the participants evaluate or create learning activities; (3) no studies look into classroom observations as part of the program, which limits our understanding to how these programs work; and (4) most programs use block-based programming languages as the tool to develop student CT. While block-based programming languages are used for introductory training programs, students are often expected to transfer their learning to more professional programming languages.",10.1145/3648477,Association for Computing Machinery,175.0,ACM,,Short Communication,India,Journal of Machine Learning Research

Introducing Computational Thinking at Vocational High Schools,"Simmonds, Jocelyn and Diaz, Constanza and Estay, Carlos",2023,"The Technovation Girls program (TG) is an after-school program, where teams of female school students follow a software ideation process to address one of the UN's Sustainable Development goals. Concretely, they prototype a mobile application which they later pitch to judges. The TG curriculum gives students the tools they need to carry out this challenge, with activities focusing on entrepreneurship, product ideation and pitching, as well as coding. Previous evaluations of this program have focused on student and mentor perceptions and attitudes, collected through surveys, observation, focus groups and interviews. In this paper, we evaluate the effect that the coding part of the TG curriculum has on students' computational thinking skills, specifically in Chile, where the TG curriculum was expanded to a year to account for differences in the school curriculum. Also, in this experience, the TG program was carried out during class hours, and at both single- and mixed-gender vocational high schools. We applied an existing computational thinking test to the 2020 cohort (approx. 1000 students), before and after participating in the program, analyzing the results by school, gender and age. We found a slight improvement in test scores, with a more positive effect in male students.",10.1145/3587102.3588818,Association for Computing Machinery,96.0,ACM,,Case Study,USA,Nature Communications
Improvement of Computational Thinking skills through unplugged activities in Upper Secondary Education,"Benavides-Escola, Christian Andr\'{e}s and Mart\'{\i}n-Barroso, Estefan\'{\i}a and Zapata-C\'{a}ceres, Mar\'{\i}a and Rom\'{a}n-Gonz\'{a}lez, Marcos",2024,"The adoption of Computational Thinking (CT) in the educational worldwide curricula is progressively gaining importance from various perspectives. One particular approach, known as unplugged, does not require electronic devices and offers notable benefits as it is replicable and adaptable. Moreover, it serves to dismantle the misconception that computer science is exclusively confined to the digital realm. While both plugged and unplugged methodologies are recognized, further exploration of the unplugged approach is required, especially in Upper Secondary Education, where there is less evidence of its effectiveness. This paper presents a summary of a quasi-experimental study conducted with 11th grade students (approximately 16 years old) in a Spanish public high school. 57 students participated: 28 in the control group and 29 in the experimental group. The conducted research, based on a quantitative and experimental design, aimed to investigate the effectiveness of unplugged activities to improve CT abilities in Upper Secondary Education. The results indicated improved skills in the experimental group, suggesting the potential efficacy of unplugged methods in fostering CT abilities.",10.1145/3677619.3678110,Association for Computing Machinery,181.0,ACM,,Editorial,USA,PLOS ONE
Infusing Computational Thinking into a Computer Science Gateway Course,"Benkarroum, Younes and Azhar, Mohammad Q.",2024,"Computational thinking (CT) stands as a universal problem-solving approach applicable across diverse disciplines, transcending the domain of computer science. It embodies the mental process of structuring a problem to enable a computational solution feasible for both humans and machines. This methodology involves dissecting problems into smaller parts that are easier to understand and solve. This study delineates a meticulously designed series of CT activities within an introductory computer science course and explores their profound impact on student engagement and problem-solving proficiency. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of hands-on CT practice in augmenting students' ability to decompose problems, recognize patterns, and abstract complexities, and employ algorithms effectively. Notably, this infusion of CT not only cultivates theoretical understanding but also bridges the gap between conceptual knowledge and real-world application through the use of computational tools like Python programming. As CT continues to emerge as a cornerstone skill in diverse domains, this research presents compelling evidence advocating for its integration into introductory courses, laying a robust foundation for students to navigate the evolving technological landscape with enhanced problem-solving capabilities.",,Consortium for Computing Sciences in Colleges,234.0,ACM,,Conference Proceedings,Argentina,Computers & Education
Computational Thinking and Notional Machines: The Missing Link,"Munasinghe, Bhagya and Bell, Tim and Robins, Anthony",2023,"In learning to program and understanding how a programming language controls a computer, learners develop both insights and misconceptions whilst their mental models are gradually refined. It is important that the learner is able to distinguish the different elements and roles of a computer (compiler, interpreter, memory, etc.), which novice programmers may find difficult to comprehend. Forming accurate mental models is one of the potential sources of difficulty inextricably linked to mastering computing concepts and processes, and for learning computer programming.It is common to use some form of representation (e.g., an abstract machine or a Computational Agent (CA)) to support technical or pedagogic explanations. The Notional Machine (NM) is a pedagogical device that entails one or more computational concepts, originally described as an idealised computer operating with the constructs of a particular programming language. It can be used to support specific or general learning goals and will typically have some concrete representation that can be referred to. Computational Thinking (CT), which is defined as a way of thinking that is used for [computational] problem solving, is often presented as using a CA to carry out information processing presented by a solution.In CT, where the typical goal is to produce an algorithm or a computer program, the CA seemingly serves a purpose very similar to an NM. Although it changes through the different stages of development (of the learner and of the curriculum), the roles of CAs and NMs can be seen as versatile tools that connect a learner’s mental model with the conceptual model of a program. In this article, we look at this relationship between CAs and NMs, and indicate how they would look at different stages of learning. We traverse the range of definitions and usages of these concepts, and articulate models that clarify how these are viewed in the literature. This includes exploring the nature of machines and agents, and how historical views of these relate to modern pedagogy for computation. We argue that the CA can be seen as an abstract, simplified variant of an NM that provides a useful perspective to the learner to support them to form robust mental models of NMs more efficiently and effectively. We propose that teaching programming should make use of the idea of a CA at different stages of learning, as a link that connects a learner’s mental model to a full NM.",10.1145/3627829,Association for Computing Machinery,153.0,ACM,,Review Paper,Mexico,Science Advances

In this paper we share our project's operational understanding of the concept of rural sustainability in the context of CT pathways. We posit that an effective CT pathway for rural communities must be firmly rooted in their cultural wealth, funds of knowledge, and socioeconomic priorities. Moreover, it should empower students to draw upon their own innovation heritage, leveraging CT as a tool to identify and address community challenges. Emphasizing the necessity of incorporating rural contexts into discussions on equitable access to computing education, our conceptualization provides insights into how policy and research can contribute to this important goal.",10.1145/3653666.3656073,Association for Computing Machinery,114.0,ACM,,Research Article,India,PLOS ONE
Computational Thinking in STEM Teaching: Preservice Teachers' Conceptualizations and Practices,"Wei, Wei and Ha, Jesse and Gomez, Kimberley and Ghosh, Anuradha",2024,"Within a two-year urban teacher residency program at [University], which focuses on training high school teachers to incorporate computational thinking (CT) into STEM education with an emphasis on equity, this study delves into how these preservice teaching residents (TRs) understood and applied CT in high school STEM settings. Based on our initial thematic content analysis of ten 30-minute artifact-based interviews, teachers' understanding and application of CT could be categorized in two ways: 1) One group of teachers showcased clear, explicit knowledge of CT and actively incorporated it into their instruction; 2) Another group, despite their evident understanding of CT, subtly and implicitly integrated CT into their teaching methods. Our findings suggest that while TRs may differ in whether they explicitly or implicitly integrated CT into their lesson plans, their comments suggest that they have foundational understandings and hold values that suggest they can build upon them. The TRs held definitional understandings of CT and had intentions to design and teach with CT integration, explicitly, or more commonly, implicitly. All of the TRs recognized opportunities in their lesson plans for teaching CT to students, which suggests the potential for more explicit integration in the future. These insights guide our subsequent efforts in teacher training, ensuring educators are equipped to weave CT into STEM lessons. Our findings contribute to a growing body of work that seeks to build strong preservice teaching practices, as they learn to translate CT knowledge into effective teaching practices while working towards higher levels of CT integration.",10.1145/3626253.3635586,Association for Computing Machinery,51.0,ACM,,Technical Report,USA,Science Advances
Towards the Unification of Computational Thinking and EUDability: Two Cases from Healthcare,"Barricelli, Barbara Rita and Fogli, Daniela and Gargioni, Luigi and Locoro, Angela and Valtolina, Stefano",2024,"This paper presents a study about the mapping of the EUDability of End-User Development (EUD) tools with the Computational Thinking (CT) skills of users. This mapping provides an approach to evaluate the suitability of a EUD environment in supporting people performing their daily work while managing and exploiting EUD tools. EUDability is a construct encompassing different dimensions that need to be assessed through a careful scrutiny by human-computer interaction experts, while CT skills should mirror those dimensions from the point of view of assessing the level of ability of users in managing problems with a computational thinking attitude. Moving from the healthcare domain, we present two cases: a tool for geriatric professionals supporting them in the preparation of cognitive exercises for elderly patients; and a tool for pharmacists, which empowers them to create robot programs related to the preparation of personalized medications. These cases have been exploited to show how to unify the EUDability assessment with the CT skills assessment. In particular, the application of the EUDability evaluation method for each tool, as well as the administration of the Computational Thinking Scale to domain experts are shown. The results of the two assessments are reported and discussed, together with the limitations of the present study. The results show the goodness of fit of the proposed EUD tools in the healthcare domain.",10.1145/3656650.3656671,Association for Computing Machinery,162.0,ACM,,Case Study,Mexico,Journal of Machine Learning Research
The Integration of Computational Thinking and Making in the Classroom,"Magda, David and Gardner-McCune, Christina and Jimenez, Yerika and Chu, Sharon and Kulkarni, Abhishek",2024,"Maker-based learning and Computational Thinking (CT) have increased in popularity in formal educational settings over the past decade. Particularly, the combination of CT and making seem to hold promise for providing opportunities for students to learn and use computing concepts outside of computing courses. This paper presents findings from a two year study of the integration of computational making into 5th and 6th grade science classrooms. Students participated in computational making interventions in which they programmed Arduino microcontrollers to create scientific models of concepts that aimed to help them engage with the science content while learning CT and making skills. In this paper, we explore the differences between the desired computing learning progressions, students' performance on assessments, and perceptions of computer science to answer: To what extent are middle school students able to learn computing through computing integrated science curriculum? We observed that the programming concepts taught were largely dependent on the needs of the science and making project. Our findings suggest that while students had opportunities to learn and use programming concepts, their performance on assessments was between 15\% and 78\% correct for conceptual and applied questions and their programming self-efficacy and their perceptions of computer science were lower than desired. We discuss the implications of these findings and the factors that impact the integration of CT in core disciplines and the challenges this presents as we aim to use integration approaches to effectively teach computing outside of computing courses and to broaden participation in computing.",10.1145/3626252.3630948,Association for Computing Machinery,86.0,ACM,,Conference Proceedings,Argentina,Computers & Education
Supporting Teacher Understanding of Computational Thinking Integration into Early Elementary Curricula,"Sherwood, Heather and Kaiser, Alice and Ferguson, Camille and Negron, Anthony and Ferrer, Ray and Labonte, Don",2024,"The recent emphasis on computational thinking (CT) integration across disciplines in elementary education nationwide is important to ensure that students are well-equipped to meet the demands of the data-driven workforce. However, this requirement poses major challenges to early elementary teachers who are faced with little direction in terms of how best to implement and assess their young student's application of these new practices.This project engaged researchers, professional development (PD) providers, and K-2 teachers to develop and design a hybrid PD experience to support teachers in a process of learning about and identifying the use of CT skills and strategies in their students' work. The hybrid PD approach utilized a combination of instructional coaching, both face-to-face and through an online Community of Practice. Researchers used a mixed-methods design to measure teachers' change over time in their understanding of how to identify emergent computational thinking in their students' work process. Data collection methods included teacher focus groups and interviews, classroom observations, and teacher pre- and post-surveys.Preliminary findings showed an increase in teachers' understanding of CT and confidence in engaging their students in CT-integrated lessons. Teachers reported that the combination of in-person PD and online Community of Practice helped them prepare to bring CT into their classroom and cited placing more of a distinct focus on teaching students the process of CT rather than just using CT vocabulary. Teachers also referenced success in evaluating their students' application of CT skills and concepts by using informal and formative assessment strategies that focus on evidence of student understanding rather than assessing CT vocabulary.",10.1145/3626253.3635540,Association for Computing Machinery,48.0,ACM,,Case Study,Japan,ACM Transactions on Graphics
Exploring Computational Thinking with Physical Play through Design,"Yu, Junnan and Hayden, Ronni and Roque, Ricarose",2023,"Physical play has often been leveraged to provide children with active and engaging learning experiences. However, coding activities are predominantly sedentary in front of the screen, and the application of physical play in Computer Science education is less explored, e.g., how can we engage in computational thinking (CT) through physical play? In this design-based exploration, we conducted three design activities where young children, college students, and researchers were invited to create physical play projects using the BBC micro:bit and reflect on their experiences. By examining participants’ projects and creating processes, we provide empirical evidence that remixing physical play activities with coding can engage learners in various CT concepts and practices, reveal how CT concepts and practices can be represented in physical play, and highlight implications for designing physical play-mediated computational learning experiences. Ultimately, we encourage more learning experiences to incorporate physical play into computing education for children.",10.1145/3585088.3589365,Association for Computing Machinery,51.0,ACM,,Technical Report,Spain,PLOS ONE

This panel examines the experiences of practitioners - educators, administrators, and curriculum designers--who have both experienced and supported others in incorporating CT in elementary school settings as a pathway to or component of computer science education. All panelists have worked with teachers not previously trained to teach CS and have encountered the many opportunities and difficulties of bringing CS to in-service teachers. They will reflect on the multiple ways educators grapple with CT: as an entry point to computer science, as a way to enrich core disciplines, and as a way to support equitable practice - for example, several of the panelists have experiences leveraging CT and other domains of CS to support the expression and development of emergent bilingual students. The panel will explore ways in which CT and its associated language and strategies for problem solving may provide a particularly helpful onramp to CS generally, including integration with other disciplines and with language about academic skills more generally.",10.1145/3626253.3631658,Association for Computing Machinery,197.0,ACM,,Review Paper,USA,Science Advances

The Students' Perspective on Computational Thinking through Flipped Classroom in K-12 Programming Course,"Choi, Wan Chong and Chang, Chi In",2024,"Programming integration into K-12 curricula has become increasingly important in the rapidly evolving educational landscape. Recognizing the need to develop computational thinking among young learners, this study investigated the impact of the flipped classroom approach on computational thinking in K-12 programming courses in Macao, focusing on primary school students' experiences with block-based programmable hardware. Employing a mixed methods research design, it combined quantitative and qualitative analyses to examine how flipped classroom activities—centered around student engagement with material through e-books, videos, and interactive classroom tasks—affected students' understanding and application of computational concepts, practices, and perspectives. Quantitative data were collected using the Programming Computational Thinking Scale (PCTS), and qualitative insights were gathered through semi-structured interviews. The results indicated significant improvements in students' computational concepts and practices, attributed to the advantages of self-study and a stratified approach to task complexity. However, advancements in computational perspectives were less pronounced, highlighting the need for more opportunities for students to refine their presentation skills. The study concluded that the flipped classroom approach, especially with tools like mBlock and Codey-Rocky, effectively nurtured computational thinking in primary school programming courses. It underscored the importance of innovative teaching methods in enhancing students' ability to apply programming concepts in problem-solving and suggested areas for further improvement in educational practices.",10.1145/3678726.3678729,Association for Computing Machinery,201.0,ACM,,Review Paper,Italy,Science Advances

The Influence of CodeCombat on Computational Thinking in Python Programming Learning at Primary School,"Choi, Wan Chong and Choi, Iek Chong",2024,"In an age of rapid technological development, primary schools now teach programming to young students, focusing on developing their computational thinking, problem-solving, and ability to use computers to create solutions. However, fostering computational thinking skills in younger students was a challenging task. The serious game CodeCombat has become a potential resource for instructing young students in primary schools on basic programming principles using Python.This study delved into the role of the serious game CodeCombat in advancing computational thinking competencies among primary school students undertaking Python in Macao. Using a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest approach, we examined 49 grade-one students over a two-week Python programming course facilitated by CodeCombat. The Computational Thinking Scale (CTS), encompassing Creativity, Cooperativity, Algorithmic Thinking, Problem Solving, and Critical Thinking, was employed to measure shifts in computational thinking before and after the teaching experiment.Data analysis through paired-sample t-test highlighted notable progress in computational thinking skills, with marked improvements specifically in Creativity, Critical Thinking, Algorithmic Thinking, and Problem Solving. However, Cooperativity did not exhibit the same upward trend, implying that CodeCombat's impact was more pronounced on solitary cognitive capabilities than collaborative skills. Moreover, the correlation between different dimensions indicated that these computational thinking skills were mutually reinforcing, suggesting that enhancing one might contribute to the development of others. The findings endorsed that game-based learning is effective in programming education and recommended integrating CodeCombat to improve computational thinking in learning Python programming in primary school.",10.1145/3669947.3669951,Association for Computing Machinery,226.0,ACM,,Editorial,Germany,Journal of Machine Learning Research

Contextual teaching can connect knowledge with reality. Through the e-learning platform combined with real-life scenarios to build a specific real situation, which can drive students to carry out rich thinking activities. Therefore, this study designed a blended contextual teaching model for the development of computational thinking based on contextual learning theory and constructivist learning theory. It was applied to the teaching of high school information technology courses, and the effectiveness of the model was verified by investigating and analyzing whether there were changes in students' academic performance and computational thinking ability under the blended contextual teaching model through the questionnaire survey method and the experimental research method.

The CT and literacy framework put forth in this study can be used as an analytic framework to highlight how instructional strategies mobilize the existing literacy and CT resources of linguistically diverse students. Based on our findings, we discuss recommendations for future integrated ELA-CT curricula.",,Association for Computing Machinery,45.0,ACM,,Research Article,USA,Science Advances

Does Musical Context Improve Computational Thinking Skills?,"Padhye, Harsh and Gibson, Rachel and Bull, Glen and Nguyen, N. Rich",2023,"The Make-To-Learn Lab at the University of Virginia developed TuneScope, a tool to facilitate computational thinking (CT) through music, to help democratize computer science education. Built upon the existing framework of Snap! (University of California, Berkeley), TuneScope leverages sound analysis, design, and music composition to engage novices with CT fundamentals. Existing research shows the benefits of using familiar contexts to teach CT, and TuneScope builds upon this with musical contexts. We have designed a course centered around the use of TuneScope to teach fundamentals of CT through music. In this paper, we investigate how students use TuneScope to develop sequential melodies, build chords, and sample recorded sounds while simultaneously learning fundamental programming principles such as algorithm design and abstraction. Using sentiment analysis, we demonstrate that students have had a largely positive experience in learning and grasping CT fundamentals throughout a diverse curriculum. As of today, the total enrollment of the course consists of over 45\% female students with a 100\% retention rate. TuneScope has also been accepted as an official Snap! library to be used by thousands of Snap! users worldwide.",10.1145/3545947.3573279,Association for Computing Machinery,158.0,ACM,,Research Article,China,Journal of Machine Learning Research
Teacher Education and Computational Thinking: Measuring Pre-service Teacher Conceptions and Attitudes,"Yadav, Aman and Caeli, Elisa Nadire and Ocak, Ceren and Macann, Victoria",2022,"In recent years, there has been a growing awareness of the need for computer science education opportunities and particularly for engaging students in computational thinking ideas and practices to help them understand how computing influences our world. At its core, computational thinking (CT) is seen as understanding how computational practices (such as, abstraction) and tools (such as modeling software) can be used to explore phenomena, solve problems, and influence our lives and society. The push for CT integration has called for preparing future educators to learn CT practices and tools through stand-alone courses and within the context of disciplinary pedagogy/methods courses. However, there are few instruments that measure pre-service teachers' attitudes towards computational thinking and its role in formal schooling. In this study, we developed and validated an instrument to measure pre-service teachers' attitudes towards CT, its role in students' lives, and their own self-efficacy to incorporate CT into their teaching. We report results from a principal components factor analysis on survey responses from 260 pre-service teachers to identify patterns and reduce the number of dimensions of comparison in the analysis. We discuss how pre-service teacher conceptions have implications for preparing future teachers to integrate computational thinking into their instruction.",10.1145/3502718.3524783,Association for Computing Machinery,227.0,ACM,,Short Communication,Brazil,ACM Transactions on Graphics
Encouraging the Development of Computational Thinking Skills through Structured Dance Activities (Discussion Paper),"Fairlie, Fiona",2024,"This paper investigates whether aspects of structured dance and choreography may improve cognitive skills related to computational thinking. It also explores the relationship between performance on computational thinking tasks and motivation. Twenty participants,aged between 7 and 9 years old, undertook the Beginners Computational Thinking Test (BCTt) as a pre-test, took part in three dance related workshops then completed the BCTt as post-test and responded to an adapted version of the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). Student performance on the BCTt improved significantly from pre-test to post-test for both boys and girls and seems generalised across the computational categories measured by BCTt. The study did not show a correlation between performance and motivation in girls but suggests that there may be some correlation between improvement in score and reported enjoyment in boys.",10.1145/3631802.3631811,Association for Computing Machinery,124.0,ACM,,Review Paper,Mexico,Journal of Computer Science
From Embodied Doing to Computational Thinking in Kindergarten: A Punctuated Motor Control Model,"Sinha, Ravi and Swanson, Hillary and Clarke-Midura, Jody and Shumway, Jessica F. and Lee, Victor R. and Chandrasekharan, Sanjay",2023,"We propose a motor control-based characterization of how computational thinking (CT) can emerge from embodied performance. The account is based on children's activity during a tangible coding task, and a mechanism proposed by cognitive and motor neuroscience studies. For the task, the child used navigational symbols (forward, backward, rotate right, rotate left) to program the movements of a tangible robot on a 2-D grid. We propose that the development of CT through this task can be understood in terms of “tool incorporation into the body schema.” To illustrate the proposed mechanism, we use video data from one of three teaching sessions, where a group of four kindergartners learned to code using Cubetto (a tactile screen-free grid-based robotic toy). We argue that learning the task (i.e. being able to control Cubetto to perform goal-oriented movements) is challenging because the CT task requires learners to bridge three distinct discontinuities (spatial, temporal, and representational), to achieve control over the robot. We hypothesize that learners and facilitators are likely to engage in moves (both epistemic and pedagogical) that help bridge these gaps, and thus support the incorporation of the robot and its controller into the body schema. We characterize two such moves and explicate how they might support the incorporation process. The study is part of a larger program of design-based research aimed at helping young children develop CT.",10.1145/3594781.3594794,Association for Computing Machinery,246.0,ACM,,Research Article,France,ACM Transactions on Graphics
Analyzing-Evaluating-Creating: Assessing Computational Thinking and Problem Solving in Visual Programming Domains,"Ghosh, Ahana and Malva, Liina and Singla, Adish",2024,"Computational thinking (CT) and problem-solving skills are increasingly integrated into K-8 school curricula worldwide. Consequently, there is a growing need to develop reliable assessments for measuring students' proficiency in these skills. Recent works have proposed tests for assessing these skills across various CT concepts and practices, in particular, based on multi-choice items enabling psychometric validation and usage in large-scale studies. Despite their practical relevance, these tests are limited in how they measure students' computational creativity, a crucial ability when applying CT and problem solving in real-world settings. In our work, we have developed ACE, a novel test focusing on the three higher cognitive levels in Bloom's Taxonomy, i.e., Analyze, Evaluate, and Create. ACE comprises a diverse set of 7x3 multi-choice items spanning these three levels, grounded in elementary block-based visual programming. We evaluate the psychometric properties of ACE through a study conducted with 371 students in grades 3-7 from 10 schools. Based on several psychometric analysis frameworks, our results confirm the reliability and validity of ACE. Our study also shows a positive correlation between students' performance on ACE and performance on Hour of Code: Maze Challenge by Code.org.",10.1145/3626252.3630778,Association for Computing Machinery,36.0,ACM,,Conference Proceedings,Spain,Journal of Machine Learning Research

Construction and Practice of Computational Thinking Structural Framework with Sternberg's Intellectual Education Theory,"Zhang, Wei and Song, Lingling and Huang, Xujun and Wang, Yi",2024,"Cultivating students' computational thinking skills is one of the important teaching goals of college computer courses, and constructing a scientific and effective structural framework for computational thinking is the basis for implementing computational thinking training. To this end, based on Sternberg's intelligence education theory, combined with software development and programming knowledge, a structural framework of computational thinking was constructed. Subsequently, a project-based teaching activity based on this framework to cultivate students' computational thinking skills was carried out in the college computer programming course ""Software Development Technology"". By measuring students' computational thinking skills before and after the activity, it was verified that the project-based teaching model based on the proposed framework had a significant effect on improving students' computational thinking skills. By constructing a structural framework of computational thinking that integrates the characteristics of disciplines, and taking programming teaching as a carrier to implement the cultivation of computational thinking skills, it can provide a new way for computer educators to cultivate students' computational thinking skills.",10.1145/3629296.3629361,Association for Computing Machinery,65.0,ACM,,Editorial,UK,Nature Communications

An empirical study on the design-based STEM + VR teaching approach to cultivate college students' computational thinking,"Li, Xing and Zhao, MingYue and Ai, Di and Zhou, XiaoChun and Xiang, Hui",2024,"Virtual reality (VR) technology has been widely used in many industries. Therefore, the cultivation of virtual reality technology talents is imminent. However, there are relatively few universities that carry out virtual reality courses. At the same time, the virtual reality course is a good carrier to cultivate computational thinking. It can improve students ' problem-solving ability, creativity and teamwork ability, which are also necessary to cultivate computational thinking. Computational thinking, as a necessary basic skill for talents in the 21 st century, needs to be improved in the training approach of college teaching. However, there are relatively few teaching approachs to cultivate computational thinking through virtual reality (VR) courses. Based on this, this study constructs a design-based STEM+VR teaching approach, which combines the interdisciplinary knowledge of STEM education with VR subject knowledge, aiming to cultivate college students ' computational thinking through virtual reality courses. In this study, a single group of pre-test and post-test experiments were conducted to investigate the complex ability of computational thinking of a college student in Wuhan, including five sub-dimensions:creativity,algorithmic hinking, collaborative ability, critical thinking and dimensional problem solving.The research shows that after the design-based STEM + VR teaching, the abilities in the sub-dimension of computational thinking are significantly improved.

Our study analyzed 124 (62 males, 62 females) Scratch projects on the Scratch website, categorized projects on the basis of each user's gender and project type, and compared their Computational Thinking scores. The results of this study suggest that project types preferred by males require more programming construct reflected in the Computational Thinking score than that of females.

Study on Mode of Cultivating Computational Thinking in Online Teaching of Information Technology:A Quasi-Experimental Study,"Yang, Hairu and Liang, Zhou and Ma, Mingyue and Zhang, Xiaoyu and Fu, Yan and Zhang, Yongmei",2024,"With the development of the digital age, online teaching and learning is becoming more widespread in schools around the world. In the online teaching environment, the teaching mode of the course is an important element that receives attention in education and teaching. The online teaching mode based on the cultivation of computational thinking can improve students' learning interest and cultivate their innovative thinking ability. However, the author found through educational internship that there are problems such as single teaching activities, lack of teacher-student interaction, poor cooperative learning, and short independent learning time in high school information technology classrooms, which lead to low computational thinking ability and are not conducive to the development of students' innovative ability. The development of students' computational thinking ability is a requirement put forward by the high school information technology curriculum to secondary school students, and the improvement of computational thinking can help students adapt to the future society and meet the demand of future innovative talents. Therefore, this study takes high school students as the research object, under the guidance of constructivism and cognitivism theories, adopts survey research, experimental research and other research methods to construct and verify the online teaching mode based on the cultivation of computational thinking in high school information technology courses. The results of the study show that the online teaching mode based on the development of computational thinking can effectively improve students' algorithmic, evaluation, decomposition, abstraction and generalization thinking abilities, and thus enhance the online learning effect.",10.1145/3670013.3670033,Association for Computing Machinery,18.0,ACM,,Review Paper,Brazil,Journal of Machine Learning Research
Bridging the Gap: Computational Thinking as a Pathway to Equitable Math Education for Neurodiverse Learners,"Kastelein, Kate and Dawson, Kelsie and Tate, Rhonda",2024,"Students who receive special services in mathematics or neurodiverse learners (NDLs) deserve to learn mathematics at a rigorous and equitable level as their peers. Yet, many of these students are not reaching proficiency. Computational thinking (CT) may function as a bridge between students' mathematical learning and their everyday lives. We argue that computational thinking is a pathway for NDLs to follow that will bridge the connections between math instruction and the real-life problems with which NDLs are eager to engage. We identified the critical elements needed to support rural special educators' integration of CT into math instruction by identifying intersections between CT, Math, and the assets of NDLs, as well as barriers to implementation. By leveraging connections from an existing RPP (Research-Practice Partnership), which focuses on CS education and Business intersection in rural Maine schools, we created an opportunity for participatory research for special educators and paraprofessionals often overlooked in these processes. We employed a multi-method, design-based research (DBR) approach. Through observational, survey, and interview data, we found that 1) educators are not currently receiving support for integrating CT in special education classrooms, 2) activities piloted by our educators were well received by students, 3) current standards and Individualized Educational Plan (IEP) requirements for NDLs are a significant barrier to implementation. The need for expanded, regular PD for special educators is evident, as is the potential for CT as a bridge for mathematical understanding for NDLs.",10.1145/3626253.3635476,Association for Computing Machinery,240.0,ACM,,Technical Report,Mexico,Computers & Education
Interweaving Digital Literacy with Computational Thinking,"George-Reyes, Carlos Enrique and Rocha Estrada, Francisco Javier and Glasserman-Morales, Leonardo David",2021,"In the educational setting, consolidating computational thinking (CT) and digital literacy (DL) as two important skills for 21st- century professionals have become more important than ever. Nonetheless, scientific literature on both topics has rarely focused on developing frames of reference that offer incorporation of the interweaving of these skills. The objective of this document is to analyze and discuss the relationship between CT and DL in a framework where technology is used for education, with the end goal of designing a conceptual proposal that shows its common elements. The result is an initial proposal of interweaving that addresses skills such as abstraction (critical/cognitive-informational-communication), algorithm design (critical/cognitive-informational), and communication as common components, among others. We concluded that this proposal must be discussed, broadened, and considered as an initial reference framework for further analyses and delving into the topic.",10.1145/3486011.3486412,Association for Computing Machinery,132.0,ACM,,Review Paper,Canada,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering

Most research into children-nature connection has focused on positive experiences. However, theories of constructive hope suggest that as well as imbuing a love of nature we should also help children understand environmental challenges. Computational thinking is a skillset that might help young children frame and address complex problems. This skillset is currently exclusively developed indoors using technological devices and indoor activities. Our research explored an opportunity to develop young children's computational thinking skills through nature play. An observation and contextual inquiry study was conducted with young children in an Early Childhood Education Centre.

Computational thinking integration in elementary teachers' science lesson plans,"Coenraad, Merijke and Cabrera, Lautaro and Killen, Heather and Plane, Jan and Ketelhut, Diane Jass",2022,"Due to the increasingly computational nature of professions, computational thinking (CT) is of growing importance to authentic science learning and the education of future scientists. To meet this need, CT integration is expanding within classrooms. We provided professional development (PD) for pre-service and in-service teachers focused on integrating CT into elementary science. At the PD culmination, 36 teachers wrote and enacted 22 unique CT-integrated science lessons, individually or with teaching partners. Waterman et al. (2020) suggested three levels of integrating CT within lesson plans: exist, labeling already present CT; enhance, adding CT components; and extend, adding activities supporting science learning with CT. Using this framework, we examined these lesson plans, their alignment to CT practices, and the level of CT integration. Our results indicated 83.3\% of teachers successfully integrated CT within their lessons, focusing on Using Data, Computational Simulations, and Programming practices. Further, we found the level of integration differed by CT practice. Data practices generally led to exist level integration, Computational Simulation practices to enhance level integration, and Programming practices tended to extend science lessons or exhibit the science topic with Programming. Our data demonstrated teachers can write CT-integrated lesson plans, but all levels of integration are not equal opportunities for authentic scientific learning. As the field seeks to offer equitable and quality CT experiences for all students integrated within disciplinary subjects, we must understand the level of CT integration and consider how different levels of integration could affect opportunities for students.",,Association for Computing Machinery,79.0,ACM,,Short Communication,Chile,Nature Communications

However, how can this emerging technology benefit the development of skills, such as Computational Thinking (CT) and Design Thinking (DT), through a meaningful process of imagining, designing and tinkering with objects that could be used in real-world problems? Our knowledge is still limited, due to the complexity of designing 3D printable models from scratch with the existing digital tools. This paper discusses a web-based tool that enables learners to create and dynamically manipulate the behavior and properties of 3D printable models with high-level programming. This design aims to foster computational thinking, creativity, and design thinking skills as it focuses on the design process of the model, its behavior and its usage after printing. It also presents the results of a pilot study in which secondary school students engaged in a Design Thinking project for designing and printing sustainable everyday objects using this design.

The advent of generative AI (GenAI) conversational agents has disrupted the landscape of SDL. However, many questions still arise about several user experience aspects of these agents. This paper focuses on two of these questions: personalization and long-term support. As such, the first part of this study explores the effectiveness of personalizing GenAI through prompt-tuning using a CT-based prompt for solving programming challenges. The second part focuses on identifying the strengths and weaknesses of a GenAI model in a semester-long programming project. Our findings indicate that while prompt-tuning could hinder ease of use and perceived learning assistance, it might lead to higher learning outcomes. Results from a thematic analysis also indicate that GenAI is useful for programming and debugging, but it presents challenges such as over-reliance and diminishing utility over time.",10.1145/3640794.3665542,Association for Computing Machinery,36.0,ACM,,Review Paper,Germany,Science Advances

Teacher Education to Integrate Computational Thinking into Elementary Science: A Design-Based Research Study,"Killen, Heather and Coenraad, Merijke and Byrne, Virginia and Cabrera, Lautaro and Mills, Kelly and Ketelhut, Diane Jass and Plane, Jandelyn D.",2023,"Computational thinking (CT) is playing an increasingly relevant role within disciplinary teaching in elementary school, particularly in science. However, many teachers are unfamiliar with CT, either because their education occurred before the popularization of CT or because CT instruction was not included in their pre-service coursework. For these teachers, CT professional development (PD) becomes a primary mechanism to close their CT knowledge gap. While CT PD has demonstrated success at increasing teacher's CT understanding, researchers have reported varied outcomes in supporting teachers to write CT-integrated lesson plans. To explore how we might support teachers to integrate CT into elementary science, we employed design-based research (DBR) in a dual-track design of in-class CT instruction for pre-service undergraduates within an elementary science methods class paired with a collaborative, multi-month PD opportunity for pre- and in-service teachers. In this article, we reflect on our 5-year period of DBR and present our design insights and implications for CT instruction and curriculum design from each iteration. Our findings on best practices will inform both teacher educators and PD providers within CT education.

Three +1 Perspectives on Computational Thinking,"Nicolajsen, Sebastian Mateos and Pischetola, Magda and Grabarczyk, Pawel and Brabrand, Claus",2021,"Computational Thinking (CT) is a highly contentious subject with many diverging meanings and definitions. This study presents a preliminary literature review of 71 peer-reviewed articles on CT. The papers indicate the existence of five main aspects that have historically been used in association with its definition: Algorithm, Abstraction, Modelling, Simulation, and Implementation. Based on this preliminary literature study, semi-structured interviews with eight CT scholars are conducted, in order to evaluate these aspects and to identify qualitatively different perspectives on CT, which integrate the mentioned aspects in different ways. From the interviews, three different perspectives emerged, focusing on: Reasoning, Simplification, and Automation. Furthermore, the goal of having computationally educated citizens is extrapolated from the interviews, indicating an additional perspective (+1) titled Empowerment, which appears as embedded within all the previous three perspectives.

Factors That Predict K-12 Teachers' Ability to Apply Computational Thinking Skills,"Tagare, Deepti",2024,"Background and Objective. Teacher assessment research suggests that teachers have good conceptual understanding of CT. However, to model CT-based problem-solving in their classrooms, teachers need to develop the ability to recognize when and how to apply CT skills. Does existing professional development (PD) equip teachers to know when and how to apply CT skills? What factors should PD providers consider while developing trainings for CT application skills?Method. This retrospective observational study used a binomial regression model to determine what factors predict teachers’ probability of performing well on a CT application skills test.Participants. Participants of this study were 129 in-service K-12 teachers from a community of practice in India.Findings. Results show that teachers who have received at least one CT training, who have a higher teaching experience, and are currently teaching CT will have a higher probability of applying CT skills correctly to problems irrespective of the subject they teach and their educational backgrounds. However, receiving a higher number of CT PD trainings was a negative predictor of teachers’ performance.Implications. Implications for school administrators, professional development providers, and researchers are discussed. Teachers need ample opportunity to teach CT in their teaching schedules. Continuous professional development does not necessarily result in improved CT application skills unless careful consideration is given to the pedagogies used and to the resolution of misconceptions that teachers may have developed in prior training. Mixing plugged and unplugged pedagogical approaches may be beneficial to encourage transfer of CT application skills across different types of problems. Last, there is a need to develop valid and reliable instruments that measure CT application skills of teachers.",10.1145/3633205,Association for Computing Machinery,151.0,ACM,,Editorial,India,Computers & Education
CT Readiness for All: Studying a Framework for Supporting Schoolwide Computational Thinking Integration Across Elementary Curricula,"Sherwood, Heather and Moeller, Babette and Fancsali, Cheri",2024,"Schools throughout the United States are engaging in efforts to integrate computational thinking (CT) across various elementary curricula. However, there is very little guidance for effective approaches to integrating CT consistently and cohesively school wide. CT Readiness for All is a two-year research project that is investigating a CT framework and self-assessment tool developed to articulate indicators associated with successful school-wide integration across elementary curricula. Data sources include focus group interviews and surveys with teachers. Although the project is still in progress, early analysis have resulted in three key findings: (a) students were able to make cross-curricular connections using CT as a problem-solving process; (b) finding time within the school day to focus on CT is challenging; and (c) administrators need to take an active role in setting the vision and definition of CT to support school-wide CT efforts.",10.1145/3626253.3635533,Association for Computing Machinery,162.0,ACM,,Case Study,Argentina,Nature Communications

Multiple Programming Languages for Improving Computational Thinking in CS1,"Lee, Dongeun and Hu, Kaoning and El Ariss, Omar and Kwon, Kibum",2023,"Computational thinking can be deemed as thinking in algorithmic way, with which one can transpose given problems into computer algorithms. Since computational thinking requires abstract reasoning, it should not depend on particular programming languages. Unfortunately, introductory programming courses (CS1) often give students false impression that their goals are to teach a particular programming language. This study shares the design of new pedagogy for CS1 that removes dependency on a particular language and promotes computational thinking by teaching multiple programming languages simultaneously. Specifically, chosen programming languages range from low-level to high-level to expose students to different levels of abstraction from the details of computer architecture. Initial student survey responses from both trial and control groups show that there are significant improvements for the trial groups.",10.1145/3545947.3576322,Association for Computing Machinery,134.0,ACM,,Short Communication,Germany,Computers & Education

This raises a fundamental question: Is the current K-12 education system adequately preparing students for success in this technology-driven era, where innovation and problem-solving skills are essential? A recent study investigated this inquiry. The goal was to integrate Computational Thinking (CT) into the domains of Creative Writing and Creative Media and measure its impacts. This poster describes the design and refinement of summer camp experiences in which predominantly Hispanic female students participated in hands-on CT-based learning to create their own creative stories and films. Educational outcomes were evident through increased student engagement, enhanced collaboration, and improved problem-solving skills, underscoring the intervention's advantages. Furthermore, the researchers gained transforming insights, recognizing the versatility of CT across domains. Camp participants experienced a shift in perspective, with a greater interest in vocations and domains connected to computing. We share lessons learned from these summer camps in the hopes that they will inform other researchers and practitioners who are interested in designing and deploying similar experiences.

Exploring Computational Thinking Practices and Gestures in the Context of Matrix Math,"Zaman, Ulia",2023,Computational thinking (CT) is a unique skill set that can provide advantages not only in the field of computer science (CS) but also in other disciplines. There is potential benefit in incorporating CT practices in other subjects so students from interdisciplinary backgrounds can also gain CT skills and apply them in their respective disciplines. This study takes a look at how students from interdisciplinary backgrounds interact using gestures and use CT to understand matrix math concepts in a group setting. A mixed-methods analysis is used to gain insight into how students’ practice CT. Data collected from pre- and post- assessments measures students’ mastery level in matrix math concepts. Video data collected during the group activity shows students’ learning process. The results of this study provide a better perspective on how other disciplines are able to utilize CT and how CT learning can be implicitly taught in subjects other than CS.,10.1145/3544549.3583944,Association for Computing Machinery,181.0,ACM,,Technical Report,UK,Nature Communications

Protobject as a tool for teaching computational thinking to designers: student perceptions on usability,"Bellino, Alessio and Herskovic, Valeria",2023,"Due to the proliferation of technology in daily life and the growing number of ways in which humans and machines interact, the process of designing interactive elements has become critical. Nevertheless, design students are seldom able to design and implement interactive elements because of their limited programming skills. Although there have been some approaches to teach computational thinking using physical computing and focusing on solving real-world problems (e.g., electronic devices such as Arduino, using sensors and actuators), they often entail monetary expenses and require knowledgeable instructors, and are not catered to students without prior programming or electronics knowledge. Hence, we propose the use of Protobject, a low-cost tool that focuses on real-world applications that could be used to teach programming to design students. This study aims to evaluate students’ perceptions regarding the usability of Protobject as a tool for learning computational thinking, as well as the clarity of the learning activities designed to teach computational thinking concepts by using Protobject.",10.1145/3605390.3605401,Association for Computing Machinery,162.0,ACM,,Research Article,Chile,Journal of Machine Learning Research

To promote and assess students’ CT skills, so-called ’Bebras tasks’ (i.e. small tasks for problem solving in informatics) are created by experts in the field of CT. There has not been empirical research to determine to what extent and how CT skills are used while solving these tasks, however. This qualitative study bridges this gap by using the think-aloud method to examine the use of CT skills when solving Bebras. The results of this study can serve as a validation for the use of CT skills in solving Bebras tasks.

In Ireland, CT is not part of the primary school curriculum or mandatory in secondary schools. However, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is in the process of revising the primary school curriculum to include aspects of CT. Our aim for creating this CT Obstacle Course is to introduce teachers (and pupils) without formal computer science training to the subject of CT. This is done in a manner that informs and motivates, and gives them the confidence to deliver CT materials in the classroom. We also want to find out from teachers how useful and important this type of resource is for developing problem-solving skills, and if our unplugged activity can support learning at various skill levels. Our CT Obstacle Course includes 14 Bebras tasks for primary schools and an additional 6 Bebras tasks for secondary schools. The activity is suitable for indoors and outdoors and is completed in groups, promoting teamwork and communication. We have delivered it to 146 primary school classes during 38 school visits between May 2021 and June 2022. It has been undertaken by 3,445 pupils and 195 teachers and other school staff.

Mobeybou for Computational Thinking: Fostering Expression Through Embodied Computing Interactions,"Saraiva, In\^{e}s and Martins, Nuno and Sylla, Cristina Maria",2023,"The impact of the COVID-19 crisis on education has opened new doors and accelerated change, and a learning opportunity has emerged towards the digital transformation of teaching models. Computing acquires a new relevance and fits into the plan to strengthen digital skills as a driver of digital knowledge, particularly relevant for children and young people. In parallel, both the close contact with computers allows the development of skills such as logical reasoning, critical thinking, creativity, communication and teamwork, and the very coexistence of citizens with digital technologies requires the prior acquisition of this knowledge, in order to be prepared to meet the new demands of modern society. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to introduce an ongoing research project that aims at developing young children's expression through embodied computing in order to enhance their digital knowledge, by adapting the digital manipulative (DM) Mobeybou for storytelling and narrative creation as a tool for promoting computational thinking (CT) and inherent competences through a bodily expression experience. The educational toolkit and base literature review are discussed, and the early prototypes of the programming language proposed are presented, as well as the ongoing and future work. With this initial work it was possible to conclude that computer programming has many benefits in fostering CT in children, alongside other cognitive skills, as well as the importance of stimulating children's expression and communication that are transversal to all areas of life. Therefore, computer programming will be used and incorporated in Mobeybou in order to achieve the research aims proposed in this paper and promote children's expression through CT development.",10.1145/3568739.3568766,Association for Computing Machinery,17.0,ACM,,Conference Proceedings,Brazil,Journal of Computer Science
The Effectiveness of Teaching Approaches in Computational Thinking Education: A Meta-Analysis,"Chen, Yunshan and Wang, Yining and Li, Yanyan",2023,"This meta-analysis examined research on the effects of different teaching approaches on students’ computational thinking (CT) from 2010 to 2022. A total of 35 articles met inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis with a total of 49 independent effect sizes. The meta-analysis results showed that the current K-12 teaching has a moderate positive impact on the development of students' computational thinking (g=0.548). Pair programming, unplugged activities, and project-based learning have the most significant effects, which are more helpful in cultivating students’ computational thinking. Moreover, we analyzed the impact of moderator variables on the relationship between K-12 teaching and computational thinking. Findings revealed that the effects of CT education were more substantial (a) for middle school students than for primary school students, (b) in interdisciplinary courses than in computer science courses, (c) with collaborative learning activities than with individual learning activities. Based on this, we suggest that paired programming, unplugged activities, and project-based learning, which are based on collaborative learning, should be used more for CT education.

Understanding barriers to school-wide computational thinking integration at the elementary grades: lessons from three schools,"Israel, Maya and Liu, Ruohan and Yan, Wei and Sherwood, Heather and Martin, Wendy and Fancsali, Cheri and Rivera-Cash, Edgar and Adair, Alexandra",2022,"This mixed methods study examined barriers faced by three elementary schools in their approaches to integrating computational thinking (CT) into classroom instruction. Because CT is a relatively new instructional area, limited research guides CT integration, especially in bringing CT to academically, linguistically, and culturally diverse instruction. This study, therefore, examined challenges faced by teachers in bringing CT into their instructional practice. Data included interviews with 11 teachers and surveys of 46 teachers in a large, urban school district. The three schools in the district were part of a CS for All initiative in their school district. Data revealed common challenges: a) Limited CT teaching expertise; b) Limited time for CT integration; c) Lack of CT-specific assessment knowledge and tools; d) Limited pedagogical understanding for meeting students' diverse instructional needs; and e) Low teacher-buy-in for teaching CT. Our data also showed differences across schools in access to classroom implementation infrastructure such as technology and curricular resources, competing administrative priorities, and types of professional development opportunities. This study points to practical implications for supporting integration of CT in elementary contexts. Most notably, it is critical to proactively address these barriers in preservice and in-service teacher preparation as well as in school-wide infrastructure in order to have a sustained CT integration effort.",,Association for Computing Machinery,45.0,ACM,,Technical Report,Mexico,Nature Communications
Computational Thinking-Integrated Elementary Science with Culturally Responsive Teaching: A Vignette Study,"Xin, Yue and Kramarczuk, Kristina Anna and Mak, Janice and Terrell Shockley, Ebony and Ketelhut, Diane Jass",2023,"In response to the persistent diversity gap that exists in the computing field, we implemented a five-day professional development (PD) workshop for elementary teachers on integrating computational thinking (CT) and culturally responsive teaching (CRT) practices into their existing science instruction. An explicit focus of this PD was to engage teachers in analyzing CT- and CRT-integrated science classroom scenarios (i.e., vignettes). Our analyses of video and written data of teachers' vignette responses indicate that while their understanding of CT increased as a result of the PD, the teachers need additional support around CRT. We suggest that future studies explore how teachers define and enact CRT, especially within their unique contexts.",10.1145/3545947.3576255,Association for Computing Machinery,239.0,ACM,,Editorial,Australia,PLOS ONE

Investigating pre-service teachers' computational thinking through lesson design using digital technologies,"Sheridan, Scott and Alkhateeb, Bataul and Mouza, Chrystalla and Yang, Hui",2022,"In this chapter, we describe a pedagogical approach aimed at preparing pre-service teachers to integrate (CT) into K-8 contexts. Specifically, we present a standalone educational technology course with explicit attention on connecting CT to disciplinary content and pedagogy while introducing a range of digital tools. Data were collected from 34 pre-service teachers over the period of one semester. Specifically, a total of 68 lesson plans developed by pre-service teachers through two distinct lesson planning tasks using concept mapping and programming tools were collected and analyzed using both quantitative and qualitative techniques. The analysis utilized a coding scheme that focused on identifying specific CT practices illustrated in each lesson. It also examined differences in the CT practices exhibited in each lesson planning task. Findings indicated that the CT practice of data was most prevalent in pre-service teachers' lesson plans. Outside of data, however, there was greater variation in the CT practices represented in programming lesson plans compared to the concept mapping lesson plans. Implications for teacher educators are discussed based on the findings.",,Association for Computing Machinery,31.0,ACM,,Review Paper,Brazil,ACM Transactions on Graphics
Computational Thinking through Tangible Play: Understanding Social Dialogues in Children's Learning,"Liu, Yu-Yu and Iversen, Ole Sejer",2022,"Through an exploratory study of a 6-year-old child and his parents, we explored the complexities of children's affective learning experience with tangible programming games, specifically focusing on the impact of scaffolding dialogues and social-emotional support. The social dialogues from this exploratory study demonstrate the interactive reasoning process in computational thinking (CT) education and reveal that dialogic learning has the potential to promote learning emotions and CT skills development in CT education. This study thus points to the future Child-Computer Interaction (CCI) research agenda that considers social dialogues in CT education with tangible play. A new understanding of social dialogues in CT toys and CT education can provide educators and CCI researchers with socio-technical insights into the future educational practices and design of CT games and technology for young children.",10.1145/3501712.3535288,Association for Computing Machinery,155.0,ACM,,Research Article,Germany,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
Computational Thinking in Teacher Education,"Floyd, Lisa Anne",2020,"Teacher education programs are beginning to acknowledge the important role they play in preparing teachers to support students in the area of STEM, coding, Computational Thinking and robotics. As a result, new courses are being developed that connect research, pedagogy and technology within this nascent field. An example of this is Western University's Computational Thinking in Mathematics and Science Education course, which has been offered in year one of the Bachelor of Education program since 2015 and is part of the STEM cohort. Research has been conducted during each iteration of the course and subsequent adjustments were made in order to better serve the preservice teachers as well as respond to new insights in the field. The preservice teachers have completed at least one university degree, mostly in the areas of science or mathematics, prior to beginning their Bachelor of Education degree. This lightning talk presents highlights from the most recent version of the course following this iterative process of course design. The 36-hour course provides pre-service teachers with opportunities to explore hands-on-activities and theoretical-based approaches to Computational Thinking and pedagogy in grades 7-12, all within a blended learning context.

Pre-Service Computer Science Teachers’ Computational Thinking Attitudes and Performance on Python Tasks,"Standl, Bernhard",2022,"For more than a decade, there has been debate about how to describe the concept of computational thinking (CT), focusing on the skills of decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition, and algorithmic thinking. As CT can also be seen as a problem-solving process, not only the skills and strategies are an important part of CT, but also the attitudes of the problem solvers. These have already been described as persistence, dealing with complexity, ambiguity, and confidence. An important competence for future computer science teachers is to confidently guide students’ problem-solving process. This work presents preliminary results on the relationship between pre-service computer science teachers’ CT attitudes and their performance on Python tasks. Therefore, N=19 pre-service computer science teachers solved three tasks in Python and rated their attitudes towards solving the tasks.

Computational Thinking Development in children both neurotypical and with Intellectual Disabilities by the Game “Pensar e Vestir”,"Soppa Geremias, Matheus and Cerigueli Dutra, Taynara and Maschio, Eleandro and Gasparini, Isabela",2024,"With a focus on problem resolution, Computational Thinking (CT) can assist in developing cognitive abilities. A way to work with CT is using educational digital games (EDG), a ludic tool that stimulates the students’ learning. Still, adjustments are needed so that students with Intellectual Disabilities (ID) can use these games. Based on this scenario, we presented a Bachelor’s final paper that envisioned the creation of an EDG, aiming to contribute to the learning of the target audience, based on the promotion of the development of CT. Called “Pensar e Vestir”, the game uses the four pillars of CT by addressing choosing and wearing clothes. For that, the development counted with a multidisciplinary group – stakeholders and specialists from the areas of Computer Science, Education, Specialized Educational Assistance, and ID – and followed the Simple Interaction Design lifecycle model, with the definition of requirements, designing alternatives, prototyping, and evaluation. As a result, this EDG has two phases and eight situations each: time to sleep, the school in the heat, school in the cold, costume, park, tour, teacher, and market. The game was evaluated by specialists, Computing students, and one neurotypical child, we also intend to make a large evaluation with the target audience. As an outcome, the interaction design process with different stakeholders and specialists provides different insights and improvements to the game.

Combining Abstract Tasks and Haptic Material to Foster Computational Thinking in Computer Science Students,"B\""{o}ttcher, Axel and Thurner, Veronika",2023,"Students of Computer Science often struggle with the abstract nature of the content of their studies, especially in the student entry phase. This is partly due to the fact that on the one hand, many first year students possess only moderate abstract thinking skills, while on the other hand, Computer Science lecturers often take the existence of abstract thinking skills for granted, as they themselves are well versed in this area. To bridge this gap and foster the students’ abstract thinking skills, we employ haptic material to make abstract tasks and the corresponding solution processes more tangible. This supports the development of abstract thinking skills, and at the same time helps to actively engage students in our classes on software development. In this paper we describe our experiences with active classroom learning units based on haptic materials, as part of our inverted classroom teaching.",10.1145/3593663.3593693,Association for Computing Machinery,49.0,ACM,,Research Article,Spain,Nature Communications

Beyond Programming: A Computer-Based Assessment of Computational Thinking Competency,"Lai, Rina P. Y.",2021,"Computational Thinking (CT), entailing both domain-general and domain-specific skills, is a competency fundamental to computing education and beyond. However, as a cross-domain competency, appropriate assessment design and method remain equivocal. Indeed, the majority of the existing assessments have a predominant focus on measuring programming proficiency and neglecting other contexts in which CT can also be manifested. To broaden the promotion and practice of CT, it is necessary to integrate diverse problem types and item formats using a competency-based assessment method to measure CT. Taking a psychometric approach, this article evaluates a novel computer-based assessment of CT competency, Computational Thinking Challenge. The assessment was administered to 119 British upper secondary school students (M = 16.11; SD = 1.19) with a range of prior programming experiences. Results from several reliability analyses, a convergent validity analysis, and a Rasch analysis, provided evidence to support the quality of the assessment. Taken together, the study demonstrated the feasibility to expand from traditional assessment methods to integrating multiple contexts, problem types, and item formats in measuring CT competency in a comprehensive manner.",10.1145/3486598,Association for Computing Machinery,84.0,ACM,,Technical Report,Japan,ACM Transactions on Graphics

Elementary Computational Thinking Instruction and Assessment: A Learning Trajectory Perspective,"Luo, Feiya and Israel, Maya and Gane, Brian",2022,"There is little empirical research related to how elementary students develop computational thinking (CT) and how they apply CT in problem-solving. To address this gap in knowledge, this study made use of learning trajectories (LTs; hypothesized learning goals, progressions, and activities) in CT concept areas such as sequence, repetition, conditionals, and decomposition to better understand students’ CT. This study implemented eight math-CT integrated lessons aligned to U.S. national mathematics education standards and the LTs with third- and fourth-grade students. This basic interpretive qualitative study aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of elementary students’ CT by having students express and articulate their CT in cognitive interviews. Participants’ (n = 22) CT articulation was examined using a priori codes translated verbatim from the learning goals in the LTs and was mapped to the learning goals in the LTs. Results revealed a range of students’ CT in problem-solving, such as using precise and complete problem-solving instructions, recognizing repeating patterns, and decomposing arithmetic problems. By collecting empirical data on how students expressed and articulated their CT, this study makes theoretical contributions by generating initial empirical evidence to support the hypothesized learning goals and progressions in the LTs.

In 2017-18, about 200 students and five teachers participated in the pilot, in 2018-2019 the participation increased to 400 students, and in the current 2019-2020 year about 800 students in 11 schools are involved. After describing the course content and the teacher training, we briefly discuss the data we have collected in the last two years. The overall student reception of the course has been positive, but the course was categorized by most students as hard. The pre-post test content assessments show that students have learned not only the language, but also general principles of programming. Lessons learned during the pilot phase have motivated changes, such as emphasizing during Professional Development the need to provide timely feedback to students, provide detailed rubrics for the projects and reorganize the lessons to increase the initial engagement with the material.

Elementary Students' Understanding of Variables in Computational Thinking-Integrated Instruction: A Mixed Methods Study,"Luo, Feiya and Yan, Wei and Liu, Ruohan and Israel, Maya",2022,"Variable is a common computer science (CS) concept and is being introduced to upper elementary students in computational thinking (CT)-integrated instruction. However, there is scant empirical evidence of when and how elementary students should learn variables. For example, national computer science (CS) standards advise introducing variables in grades 3-5 and a K-8 variable learning trajectory (LT) synthesized learning goals from the literature and hypothesized four levels of thinking in working with variables. Yet, little empirical research lies behind these. This mixed methods study examined elementary students' understanding of variables. Participants were sampled from two fourth-grade classes from a Midwestern elementary school that implemented a series of CT-integrated math lessons. Students' written responses to variables assessment items were analyzed. Additionally, cognitive think-aloud interviews were conducted with nine students to elicit students' understanding while solving the variables assessment items. Our findings suggested that most students lacked a conceptual understanding of using variables to create generalized problem solutions that could work with any set of inputs. Additionally, students had difficulty with specific mechanics of using variables such as storing user input in a variable, updating variable values, and using the values stored in variables. This study underscores the need for careful design, use, and analysis of elementary CT-integrated lessons and assessments to introduce and reinforce the conceptual understanding and specific mechanics of variables for elementary students.",10.1145/3478431.3499323,Association for Computing Machinery,198.0,ACM,,Review Paper,France,PLOS ONE

While diagrams are frequently employed in university computing, little is known about its applications in K-8 (ages 6-14) computing.To inform diagram design for K-8 computing, we investigated how the spatial orientation of a diagram (horizontal or vertical) influenced the extent to which K-8 teachers developed different technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) of computational thinking (CT) concepts, such as loops, conditionals, and decomposition. We found that more teachers were able to decompose a sequence of events when using a vertical diagram. While teachers in both conditions were similarly able to describe various CT concepts and aspects of TPACK, more teachers using a vertical diagram made connections between concepts, whereas more teachers using a horizontal diagram described concepts in isolation. We hope this exploration will spur future work into diagramming and more broadly, spatial reasoning in K-8 computing.",10.1145/3545945.3569737,Association for Computing Machinery,154.0,ACM,,Editorial,Brazil,PLOS ONE

The Influence of Code.org on Computational Thinking and Learning Attitude in Block-Based Programming Education,"Choi, Wan Chong",2023,"In recent years, the elementary schools in Macao have increasingly offered programming curriculum. Programming curriculum emphasizes computational thinking, which is the capacity to analyze, design algorithms, and find solutions to programming problems. However, it is not easy to develop students’ computational thinking abilities. In addition, students' poor learning attitudes are connected to difficulties in learning programming. Therefore, it is crucial for educators to investigate how to improve students' computational thinking and learning attitudes. This study applied a quasi-experimental research method to a single group and used a pretest-posttest method to measure the influence of using Code.org on computational thinking and learning attitudes. The participants were 20 third-grade students in an elementary school in Macao. The teaching duration is carried out for three weeks, six lessons per week, a total of eighteen lessons, and 40 minutes per lesson. The Programming Computational Thinking Scale (PCTS) and the Attitude Scale of Computer Programming Learning (ASCOPL) were used to evaluate the implementation's effect. After analyzing the questionnaire scores and students' achievements on the Code.org website, it was found that after receiving the Code.org instruction, students were able to complete most of the stage of the Course B curriculum in Code.org, and their computational thinking and learning attitudes have improved significantly.",10.1145/3578837.3578871,Association for Computing Machinery,197.0,ACM,,Research Article,Spain,PLOS ONE
An empirical study on designing STEM + AI teaching to cultivate primary school students ' computational thinking perspective,"Li, Xing and Xiang, Hui and Zhou, Xiaochun and Jing, Huang",2023,"With the development of the era of artificial intelligence (AI), China has put forward the cultivation of computational thinking (CT) in the compulsory education curriculum standard. CT includes three dimensions: CT concept, CT practice and CT perspective. As a part of CT, the development of CT perspective can promote the growth of students ' connection ability, questioning ability and expression ability. CT perspective promotes the formation of computational identity through the internalization of concepts. At present, there are relatively few studies on the CT perspective. Based on this, this study proposes a design-based STEM + AI teaching model, aiming to create a combination of artificial intelligence and interdisciplinary to cultivate pupils ' CT perspective. In this study, a single group of pre-test and post-test experiments were conducted to test the CT perspective of students in third grade of a primary school in Wuhan. The research shows that the design-based STEM + AI teaching has significantly improved the expression ability and questioning ability of primary school students, but the improvement of connection ability is not significant. The implementation of STEM + AI teaching helps students to internalize ideas from the perspective of CT, thus cultivating students ' computational identity.",10.1145/3606094.3606130,Association for Computing Machinery,17.0,ACM,,Conference Proceedings,China,ACM Transactions on Graphics
Making the Transition to Text-Based Programming: The Pilot Evaluation of a Computational Thinking Intervention for Primary School Students,"Kunz, Katrin and Moeller, Korbinian and Ninaus, Manuel and Trautwein, Ulrich and Tsarava, Katerina",2023,"Programming and computational thinking (CT) have become important topics in elementary education and are being implemented by national curricula, extracurricular programs, and informal learning environments. Most related research and implementation is mainly focused on block-based programming (BBP). However, BBP can lead to bad programming habits and a later transition to text-based programming (TBP) has been shown to be difficult for students, as they can lose confidence and motivation. Thus, we developed a course to facilitate the transition from BBP to TBP and foster CT while also promoting motivation and students’ programming-related self-concept. We considered data from 27 fourth-grade students aged 9 to 10, who participated in the course as part of an extracurricular enrichment program. In a pre-/post-test design, we assessed CT and its cognitive correlates such as non-verbal visuospatial reasoning, verbal reasoning, arithmetic competencies as well as the student’s motivation and attitude towards programming. Results indicated improved students’ CT, arithmetic, and non-verbal visuospatial reasoning. Furthermore, the transition to TBP did not significantly reduce students’ motivation for programming. Taken together, these findings indicate that the developed intervention may be helpful to facilitate the transition from BBP to TBP while keeping the students motivated and fostering CT.",10.1145/3605468.3609770,Association for Computing Machinery,107.0,ACM,,Editorial,Brazil,Journal of Computer Science

The Effects of Using Poly-Universe on Computational Thinking in Biology and Physical Education,"Schmidthaler, Eva and Schalk, Maritta and Schmollm\""{u}ller, Matthias and Sabitzer, Barbara and Andjic, Branko and Lavicza, Zsolt",2023,"Today’s teaching and didactical methods are trying more and more to integrate digital technologies and computational thinking (CT) into other subjects. One way of combining and integrating these important skills and CT into all subjects, school levels, and school types is to include the game Poly-Universe (PolyUni). According to the results of the Poly-Universe in School Education (PUSE) study 2018, the game can be expected to have a positive effect on visual perceptual progress, including isolation and the development of shape-background skills. So far, however, comparatively few attempts have been made to explore the educational possibilities of PolyUni for different school levels and subjects, besides mathematics. This research explores how PolyUni can be used to promote CT and to evaluate whether the learning objectives in the subjects of physical education and biology have been achieved. Furthermore, it examines how PolyUni combines the requirements of the different curricula in secondary school, based on self-designed tasks. Additionally, further aspects PolyUni can promote besides the curriculum in secondary school are discussed. To explore the above-mentioned aspects, a mixed-methods study methodology was used. The participant observation method was employed for qualitative data collection, and a self-designed assessment grid and additional picture analysis were used for the quantitative data. The game was utilized in two workshops for biology and physical education at an Austrian secondary school, and fifty-six students were observed and analyzed. Based on the present data, it can be assumed that PolyUni helps to achieve the requirements of the curricula and pre-defined teaching and learning objectives in a playful way. Furthermore, the game not only promotes CT in secondary school but also encourages enjoyment and collaboration between peers in biology and physical education lessons.",10.1145/3572549.3572554,Association for Computing Machinery,97.0,ACM,,Conference Proceedings,France,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering

However, literature in the field shows that initiatives for developing this ability rarely address challenging contexts audiences. In this paper, we draw on the notion of mental models to relate the concepts of Computational Thinking and Digital Culture. We claim that practicing basic skills when exploring simple prototypes favors people to build mental models that are useful to understand and use technologies. In a case study, we engaged adults in their initial stages of literacy in activities that evolved from basic ones with a low fidelity ATM prototype to complex ones with a functional prototype. We identified that participants used the experience and knowledge they obtained from previous activities to carry out the next ones, showing confidence and autonomy when exploring a functional prototype.",10.1145/3488392.3488401,Association for Computing Machinery,91.0,ACM,,Case Study,India,ACM Transactions on Graphics
Coding with Minecraft: The Development of Middle School Students’ Computational Thinking,"Kutay, Emine and Oner, Diler",2022,"The purpose of this study is to examine the role of Minecraft-based coding activities on computational thinking (CT) of middle school students. In the study, CT was conceptualized so that it encapsulates not only the knowledge of computational concepts (e.g., loops and conditionals) but also the use of CT practices (e.g., testing and debugging). Data were collected using a combination of knowledge of computational concepts tests, the Minecraft-based coding artifacts, and one-on-one student interviews focusing on the processes of developing computational artifacts. The participants were 20 fifth-grade middle school students from a low-income public school with very limited (if none) formal computer programming experiences before the study. The Minecraft-based coding activities were designed and implemented as an instructional program to last 6 weeks. The results of the study showed a statistically significant increase in students’ knowledge of computational concepts. Based on the analysis of the students’ final coding artifacts, we identified that students mostly used the concepts of sequences, events, loops, and parallelism correctly, whereas variables, operators, and conditionals appeared to be the least successfully used concepts. The qualitative analysis of the artifact-based interviews showed that students employed the CT practices of testing and debugging most of the time while developing an artifact through coding. In contrast, the least resorted CT practice appeared to be reusing and remixing.",10.1145/3471573,Association for Computing Machinery,208.0,ACM,,Editorial,Brazil,Science Advances

Piaget and Computational Thinking,"Zipitr\'{\i}a, Sylvia da Rosa",2018,"In this article I present a theoretical framework for the concept ""computational thinking"". I do so in response to some of the problems and consequences of the lack of viable theoretical foundations; especially in relation to the development in recent years of many educational practices that claim the term ""computational thinking"". I therefore introduce my extension of Jean Piaget's general law of cognition which arose as a result of my empirical research on novice learners knowledge of the concept of a program as an executable object. Said empirical study is briefly described in this paper as a means to highlight the key to my extension of Piaget's general law, which is the insight of how the thought processes and methods involved in cases where the subject must instruct an action to a computer differ from those in which the subject instructs another subject, or performs the action themselves. My theory explains the difference between algorithmic thinking and computational thinking by adequately locating it in the specificities of the subject instructing a computer. Hence, in this article I claim that my extension of Piaget's law offers a more empirically thorough and theoretically sound way forward in the conceptual development of ""computational thinking"" than the alternatives that are being debated in academia to the present day.",10.1145/3289406.3289412,Association for Computing Machinery,138.0,ACM,,Conference Proceedings,Mexico,Journal of Computer Science

An automatic grading system for a high school-level computational thinking course,"Tisha, Sirazum Munira and Oregon, Rufino A. and Baumgartner, Gerald and Alegre, Fernando and Moreno, Juana",2023,"Automatic grading systems help lessen the load of manual grading. Most existent autograders are based on unit testing, which focuses on the correctness of the code, but has limited scope for judging code quality. Moreover, it is cumbersome to implement unit testing for evaluating graphical output code. We propose an autograder that can effectively judge the code quality of the visual output codes created by students enrolled in a high school-level computational thinking course. We aim to provide suggestions to teachers on an essential aspect of their grading, namely the level of student competency in using abstraction within their codes. A dataset from five different assignments, including open-ended problems, is used to evaluate the effectiveness of our autograder. Our initial experiments show that our method can classify the students' submissions even for open-ended problems, where existing autograders fail to do so.

Teaching Computational Thinking through Civics: NYC's Hack League,"Davis, Kylie and Shneyer, Elana",2020,"This poster provides an overview of the goals and objectives of the New York City Department of Education's (NYCDOE) Hack League, a district-wide competition that invites middle and high school students with any level of CS experience to explore the systemic impacts and applications of computing. By requiring participants to interact with data and prototype a proposed solution to an issue that the data illuminates, students creatively engage in a human-centered design and strategic problem-solving process aimed at improving the quality of life and civic issues in their communities. Each stage of competition represents a component of the engineering design process, thereby encouraging students to be thoughtful programmers. Through three stages of competition, students identify an issue and validate it with data, outline and prototype a solution while incorporating feedback from industry professionals and subject matter experts, and build metrics into their product. Making open data accessible to students has proven to be an effective approach to developing citizen scientists in NYC.

Confidence is the Key: Unlocking Predictive Factors of Latinx Elementary Students on a Computational Thinking Measure,"Garcia, Leiny Y. and Parker, Miranda C. and Ojeda-Ramirez, Santiago and Warschauer, Mark",2023,"As computing education begins to grow in K-12 classrooms, it is increasingly important to understand the relationships between a student's coding attitudes and computing outcomes. While work has been done at the undergraduate and high school level, less is known about elementary students, and even less about Latinx students. We sought to explore the connections between Latinx elementary students' coding attitudes and computational thinking (CT) skills after participating in a year-long, remote computing curriculum in a public school district in Southern California. We collected validated measures on coding attitudes and CT skills for 164 fourth-grade students. We used structural equation modeling to analyze the relationship between the coding attitude constructs (i.e., confidence, utility, perception of coders, social influences, and interest) and scores on a CT assessment while controlling for demographic factors (i.e., gender, English language fluency, free or reduced lunch status, reading and math standardized test scores). In a model demonstrating acceptable fit, only math scores were a significant predictor of CT scores and coding confidence. Confidence was found to be significantly associated with the other attitude constructs except for perception of coders. Our results indicate that confidence plays a prominent role in student computing learning, especially at a young age. Efforts to better support Latinx students in computer science should include strategies that address students' coding confidence, such as developing positive perceptions of a student's learning process (e.g., failures as learning opportunities) in specific coding skills and practices (e.g., tinkering, debugging).",10.1145/3545945.3569856,Association for Computing Machinery,82.0,ACM,,Case Study,Chile,PLOS ONE

Results showed that students liked working with Scratch and liked working on social-emotional challenges. The workshop was found to work well and students worked independently. Pair work activity was found to be particularly beneficial. Although some issues initially proved challenging (mostly relating to “how to” issues in Scratch), these may easily be addressed by making suitable adaptations to the introduction of the program provided on Day 1 of the workshop.",10.1145/3543758.3549885,Association for Computing Machinery,234.0,ACM,,Conference Proceedings,USA,Computers & Education
Research on the Improvement of Teachers' Computational Thinking Teaching Ability Based on STEM86 Platform,"Wang, Juan and Bai, Xinye and Xiang, Qianchen and An, Langsha and Cai, Minghan and He, Chunlin",2022,"At present, there is a certain lag in the teaching ability of computational thinking in our country. This article is based on STEM86 platform, ISTE published by the author ""Educator standards: Under the guidance of computational Thinking ability, a standard system for evaluating teachers' computational thinking teaching ability was constructed, and a test scale for evaluating teachers' computational thinking teaching ability was designed. The reliability and validity test and difficulty differentiation test proved that the designed test scale had good scientificity and reliability. On this basis, using this scale, through the empirical way, from three dimensions of computer discipline knowledge and skills, teaching design ability, evaluation and reflection ability to evaluate teachers before and after using STEM86 platform computational thinking teaching ability changes.

CoTinker - A Toolkit for Supporting Computational Thinking and Collaboration in High School Education.,"Musaeus, Line Have and Petersen, Marianne Graves and Klokmose, Clemens Nylandsted and Iversen, Ole Sejer",2022,"Computational thinking (CT) has been recognized as an important part of K-12 education in many countries and is often described in term relating to computer science both in concepts and context. However, the unique practice of computer scientists collaborating on problem solving is often overlooked in CT education in high school. We believe that collaboration is a key aspect of modern computing, and propose to integrate collaborative CT activities into existing high school education. The aim is to prepare students better for exploring computational approaches to high school disciplines as they are practiced in the professional world. Our research question is: how can we design tools for supporting students' collaboration while teaching CT in high school? A new computational environment, CoTinker, has been developed. The tool uses a cross-device approach and foster students' verbal communication and collaboration in groups. The tool was tested in a Biology class. Students' computational thinking (CT) was assessed through learning activities and students' communication was analyzed by audio recordings, of students, imbedded in CoTinker and by focus group interviews with students. Preliminary findings showed students being able to collaborate and solve CT tasks in groups independent of teacher or researchers. Results also indicated that students were able to use, navigate, and critically reflect upon the CoTinker environment.",10.1145/3478432.3499234,Association for Computing Machinery,143.0,ACM,,Short Communication,Japan,ACM Transactions on Graphics
A Framework for Decomposition in Computational Thinking,"Rich, Peter J. and Egan, Garrett and Ellsworth, Jordan",2019,"Computational Thinking has become an important cognitive skill to develop in all areas of education. Despite its increasing popularity, the construct itself is only partially understood. There are few measures currently in place that advance our understanding of computational thinking and its subconstructs. In this article, we analyze existing measures of computational thinking (CT), looking specifically at their measures of decomposition. Decomposition is defined as the process of breaking down a problem into its sub-components. Even though most definitions of computational thinking include decomposition, fewbreak down the decompositional process beyond a basic definition. As one of the first steps in the computational thinking process, it is important to better understand the various manners in which decomposition occurs, which methods are most effective, and under what conditions. To better understand the decompositional process, we analyze evidence of decompositional process in a variety of disciplines. We then present a framework for decomposition in computational thinking. We demonstrate how this framework may help educators to better prepare students to break down complex problems, as well as provide guidance for how decompositional ability might be measured.",10.1145/3304221.3319793,Association for Computing Machinery,177.0,ACM,,Editorial,India,ACM Transactions on Graphics

Classroom use of these robots may involve use by groups of children due to cost, logistical, and pedagogical reasons. To understand design factors affecting the social use of these robots, we explored the use of three programmable robots with distinctive design characteristics in a kindergarten classroom. Our findings suggest that programmable robot designs that may work well for use by individual children may cause difficulties when shared by groups of children if not all children in the group are able to easily perceive the input (program), output (robot actions), or program state.

Integrating computational thinking into K-12 teacher preparation: a collaborative partnership between the department of computer science and the college of education: panel discussion,"Flinn, Michael B. and McGee, Kristine and Barnes, Katelyn and Morton, Haylee",2021,"Computer science education is more important than ever. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted our society's reliance on computing and its power to help businesses innovate and adapt, yet at the same time has surfaced greater disparities for students studying computer science. Computing is the number one source of all new wages in our economy, and there are currently 400,000 open computing jobs across the United States. However, unequal access to computer science instruction and opportunities to engage in computational thinking and practices remain prevalent (Google \&amp; Gallup, 2015). In the 2018-19 school year, only 15 percent of Maryland graduates took at least one computing related course, and there were significant gaps in the course taking patterns by gender and race (Maryland Center for Computing Education, 2021). To grow students' competencies with computational thinking and computer science, it is essential to build the capacity of teachers to integrate computational thinking competencies and standards into their practice. The Frostburg State University College of Education's Maryland Accelerates (MA) Program provides aspiring teachers the opportunity to earn an accelerated Master of Arts in Teaching (Elementary or Secondary track) degree along with an innovative yearlong teacher residency in partnership with Frederick and Garrett County Public Schools. One of the primary goals of the program is to integrate mathematical problem solving and computational thinking to promote scientific inquiry in partnering elementary and secondary schools. To this end, Frostburg State University has developed an exciting opportunity for Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) students to earn a microcredential in Computational Thinking that is aligned to the ISTE Educator Standards, the High Leverage Practice Standards from TeachingWorks, and the Interstate Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium InTASC Model as part of their teacher preparation program. In this panel, faculty from the Computer Science Department and the College of Education at Frostburg State University will discuss their partnership to develop a microcredential for Computational Thinking for pre-service teachers, how and why the credential was developed, and what competencies aspiring teachers develop. Two recent graduates of the Maryland Accelerates MAT Teacher Residency program will discuss their experience using these skills and knowledge during their residency and how they plan to apply and integrate computational thinking into their practice as new teachers.",,Consortium for Computing Sciences in Colleges,68.0,ACM,,Case Study,Japan,PLOS ONE

In this experience report, we will describe the workshop design and share the perspectives of the participating K-5 teachers. One particular area of focus of the workshop was integrating 'plugged' or technology-based computing examples for the teachers. Further, we engaged the teachers with a discussion of the role of CT in promoting equity for students and demonstrated ways in which student cultural experiences could be activated through creative computing. Specific outcomes of the work included increased confidence and value in CT vocabulary usage, ideas to infuse existing curriculum with CT ideas, and teacher belief that CT could be used as a ""gateway"" for learning CS.

Teachers’ understanding of technical terms in a Computational Thinking curriculum,"Munasinghe, Bhagya and Bell, Tim and Robins, Anthony",2021,"Teachers new to computing who are not familiar with technical “jargon” can feel like they have landed in a foreign world, making them reluctant to take on the subject, and potentially leading to misconceptions and misunderstandings in the classroom. The diversity of technical words, metaphors, and phrases in different contexts can make their meanings confusing, ambiguous or misunderstood for the diverse user groups in computing education. Therefore, understanding the nature of the commonly claimed difficulties and confusion caused by computer jargon among teachers becomes important for finding ways to address this issue. This paper presents the findings of an empirical study conducted to understand the nature of teachers’ understanding of computational terms (jargon) related to Computational Thinking concepts, and how a relevant professional development intervention can help to resolve issues related to them. The results indicate that the nature of the teachers’ understanding of computational terms can be either that the computational meaning is not known, that the computational context is unclear, or their applicability is unclear. Concerns about teachers finding computer jargon difficult to understand can be because the computational context in which they are applied makes them difficult for teachers to understand, rather than not knowing their meanings in the first place. Moreover, appropriate support can enable teachers to learn the techniques and skills that the terminology refers to.",10.1145/3441636.3442311,Association for Computing Machinery,26.0,ACM,,Editorial,Japan,Journal of Machine Learning Research

How to effectively improve the teaching effect and cultivate students' computational thinking ability has become the focus of most scholars. With the extensive development of ""Internet+"", the traditional face-to-face offline teaching mode has been unable to meet the diversified and personalized learning needs of students, and blended learning has become a brand-new teaching mode, and studies have shown that blended learning can effectively improve the computational thinking ability of learners. Therefore, this study analyzes and discusses the current situation of high school students' computational thinking ability in blended learning, which helps us to deeply understand the current situation of high school students' blended learning, think about how to promote high school students' blended learning, and improve high school students' computational thinking ability, so as to promote the quality of education and teaching. In this study, the literature research method, interview analysis method and questionnaire survey method were used to investigate the current situation of blended teaching activities on the cultivation of computational thinking with 138 freshmen, sophomores and juniors in a high school in western China. The results found that the overall situation of computational thinking level in blended learning of students in a high school in western China was moderate. This was characterized by better levels of cooperative and critical thinking skills, and poorer levels of creativity, algorithmic thinking and problem solving skills.

Thinking about Computational Thinking: Lessons from Education Research,"Grover, Shuchi",2019,"Computational thinking (CT) is a means to help learners engage in authentic disciplinary and problem-solving practices of computer science (CS). For CS classrooms, CT is considered ""thinking like a computer scientist"". CT is believed to be an important learning goal of introductory CS in addition to CS concepts and programming. Despite the growing attention on CT in K-12 CS education, there is lingering confusion on the what and how of CT, and CT's relationship to coding and CS. Education research on disciplinary thinking skills in science and mathematics education can provide guidance for teaching and learning of CT. For example, (a) The shift in emphasis on disciplinary thinking helps focus on deeper conceptual understanding rather than rote learning of knowledge and facts. Hence thinking like a scientist, or mathematician, historian or computer scientist, draws attention to authentic practices of those disciplines. (b) Thinking skills are best taught in context. Therefore, CT should be taught in CS classrooms or integrated into learning of other subjects rather than taught as a separate skill or subject. (c) Even if there is no transfer beyond the context in which they are taught, a focus on thinking skills helps in deeper conceptual learning; (d) Like critical or creative thinking, CT should be integrated into other subjects to enrich learning. Research on meaningful technology integration across subjects provides useful frameworks to inform CT integration efforts.

Investigating the Role of Cognitive Abilities in Computational Thinking for Young Learners,"Salac, Jean and Thomas, Cathy and Butler, Chloe and Franklin, Diana",2021,"With the global movement to incorporate computer science instruction into elementary education, learners are being introduced to computer science and computational thinking (CS/CT) ideas at increasingly younger ages. At these early ages, young learners are developing cognitive abilities foundational to their education. While other discipline-based education fields, such as math, science, and reading, have long studied the role of cognitive abilities, such as short-term working memory and long-term retrieval, in their respective fields, similar research in computer science education is relatively sparse. In this exploratory study, we examined the relationship between cognitive abilities and CS/CT performance of fourth-grade students (ages 9-10) who underwent either an introductory CT curriculum based on Use–&gt;Modify–&gt;Create or the same curriculum with additional scaffolding from the TIPP&amp;SEE metacognitive learning strategy. Our analysis revealed performance on CT assessments to be weakly correlated with working memory and long-term retrieval, with correlations increasing as the CT concepts grew more complex. This suggests that scaffolding beyond TIPP&amp;SEE may be needed with more complex CT concepts. We also found that when using TIPP&amp;SEE, students scoring below average on cognitive ability tests performed as well as students in the control condition with average cognitive ability scores. These results indicate TIPP&amp;SEE’s potential in creating more equitable computing instruction. We hope that results from this initial exploration can help encourage further study into the role of cognitive abilities in CS/CT education for young learners.",10.1145/3446871.3469746,Association for Computing Machinery,87.0,ACM,,Review Paper,Chile,ACM Transactions on Graphics

Modifying Curriculum for Novice Computational Thinking Elementary Teachers and English Language Learners,"Saito-Stehberger, Dana and Garcia, Leiny and Warschauer, Mark",2021,"The demand for computational thinking (CT) problem solving abilities surge as every aspect of life becomes more dependent on complex digital technologies. Just as in math and language, a strong CT foundation needs to be established in early education in order for students to develop an instinctive CT perspective of the world. The urgent demand for CT instruction in elementary school quickly draws attention to the shortage of elementary school-level teachers qualified and interested in CT. Additionally, with a commitment to equity in the United States education system and knowledge of the high percentage of English language learning (ELL) students in schools, the obligation to create curricula that will provide access to CT knowledge, skills, and practices for elementary-level ELL students is loudly apparent. In response to these two needs, our team has adapted existing Scratch-based CT curriculum to support classroom teachers with minimal CT experience and to be more accessible to English language learners.

Cognitive Correlates of Computational Thinking: Evaluation of a Blended Unplugged/Plugged-In Course,"Tsarava, Katerina and Leifheit, Luzia and Ninaus, Manuel and Rom\'{a}n-Gonz\'{a}lez, Marcos and Butz, Martin V. and Golle, Jessika and Trautwein, Ulrich and Moeller, Korbinian",2019,"Coding as a practical skill and computational thinking (CT) as a cognitive ability have become an important topic in education and research. It has been suggested that CT, as an early predictor of academic success, should be introduced and fostered early in education. However, there is no consensus on the underlying cognitive correlates of CT in young elementary school children. Therefore, the present work aimed at (i) assessing CT and investigating its associations to established cognitive abilities, and (ii) evaluating a newly developed CT course for elementary school children.As such, 31 7-10-year-old children took part in 10 lessons of a structured CT course. The course aimed at introducing and fostering CT concepts in both unplugged and plugged-in ways, incorporating life-size board games, Scratch, Scratch for Arduino, and Open Roberta programming environments. In a pre-/post-test design, we assessed several cognitive abilities using standardized tests on nonverbal-visuospatial and verbal reasoning abilities, numeracy, as well as short-term memory, and measured CT using an adapted version of the only existing validated test CTt, to accommodate it to the younger sample.We identified significant associations between CT and nonverbal-visuospatial reasoning, as well as different aspects of numeracy (e.g., fact retrieval and problem completion). In line with recent theoretical accounts and empirical investigations for other age groups, these findings specify the underlying cognitive mechanism of CT in elementary school. Moreover, our results indicated that students were able to specifically improve their CT abilities through the course, as assessed by the adapted version of the CTt.",10.1145/3361721.3361729,Association for Computing Machinery,113.0,ACM,,Technical Report,Chile,PLOS ONE
Understanding Students' Computational Thinking through Cognitive Interviews: A Learning Trajectory-based Analysis,"Luo, Feiya and Israel, Maya and Liu, Ruohan and Yan, Wei and Gane, Brian and Hampton, John",2020,"For K-8 computer science (CS) education to continue to expand, it is essential that we understand how students develop and demonstrate computational thinking (CT). One approach to gaining this insight is by having students articulate their understanding of CT through cognitive interviews. This study presents findings of a cognitive interview study with 13 fourth-grade students (who had previously engaged in integrated CT and mathematics instruction) working on CT assessment items. The items assessed four CT concepts: sequence, repetition, conditionals, and decomposition. This study analyzed studentstextquotesingle articulated understanding of the four CT concepts and the correspondence between that understanding and hypothesized learning trajectories (LTs). We found that 1) all students articulated an understanding of sequence that matched the intermediate level of the Sequence LT; 2) a majority of studentstextquotesingle responses demonstrated the level of understanding that the repetition and decomposition items were designed to solicit (8 of 9 responses were correct for repetition and 4 of 6 were correct for decomposition); and 3) less than half of studentstextquotesingle responses articulated an understanding of conditionals that was intended by the items (4 of 9 responses were correct). The results also suggested questioning the directional relationships of two statements in the existing Conditionals LT. For example, unlike the LT, this study revealed that students could understand ""A conditional connects a condition to an outcome'' before ""A condition is something that can be true or false.''",10.1145/3328778.3366845,Association for Computing Machinery,87.0,ACM,,Conference Proceedings,Canada,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
Teaching how to teach computational thinking,"Lamprou, Anna and Repenning, Alexander",2018,"Computational Thinking is argued to be an essential skill for the workforce of the 21st century. As a skill, Computational Thinking should be taught in all schools, employing computational ideas integrated into other disciplines. Up until now, questions about how Computational Thinking can be effectively taught have been underexplored preventing efforts to cross the large gap between early adopters and the early majority, conceptualized as the Computer Science Education chasm. A promising strategy to cross the chasm is underway in Switzerland. Switzerland recently introduced a national curriculum, called Lehrplan 21, mandating Computer Science Education. This mandate requires the Computer Science education of elementary and middle school students. In 2017, the School of Education of Northwestern Switzerland (PH FHNW), introduced a mandatory pre-service teacher Computer Science Education course, to satisfy this mandate. All the PH FHNW students who study to become elementary school teachers must pass this two-semester course. The first part of this course was taught for the first time in fall of 2017. This paper presents the philosophy of this course and an initial analysis of both qualitative data capturing the students’ perceptions of Computational Thinking and quantitative data describing shifts in students’ skills and attitudes as effect sizes. The data suggest that it is possible to teach a basic understanding of programming to non-self-selected pre-service elementary school teachers.",10.1145/3197091.3197120,Association for Computing Machinery,16.0,ACM,,Conference Proceedings,Argentina,Nature Communications
Assessing Computational Thinking Skills at First Stages of Schooling,"Kalliopi, Kanaki and Michail, Kalogiannakis",2020,"Computational thinking has already been acknowledged as an important learning objective for all students in compulsory education. Our research interests focus on the assessment of fundamental computational thinking competencies, such as collection, organisation and analysis of data, algorithmic thinking and abstraction. For the needs of our research, we implemented the digital platform PhysGramming, which constitutes the backbone of a relevant assessment tool we have built. PhysGramming is developmentally appropriate for first and second grade primary school students and provides the opportunity to create their own digital games, transforming them from passive consumers to active creators of digital technology. The assessment tool has been applied to 450 students in the first and second grade of primary schools on Crete, Greece from February to June 2019. The research was conducted attuned to the ethical guidelines of educational research, within the framework of the physical and natural science courses and evolved around three axes: (a) Checking the validity and the reliability of the results that come out when applying the proposed assessment tool. (b) Designating the levels of computational thinking skills of students at first stages of schooling. (c) Checking the correlation between the levels of computational thinking skills and the comprehension of the lesson's content. In other words, we check whether high learning performance is a necessary and sufficient condition for diagnosing high levels of basic computational thinking skills. In this paper, we shortly describe the assessment tool we propose.",10.1145/3371647.3371651,Association for Computing Machinery,238.0,ACM,,Editorial,Spain,Nature Communications
Primary School Teachers' Conceptions of Computational Thinking,"Garvin, Megean and Killen, Heather and Plane, Jan and Weintrop, David",2019,"Computational thinking (CT) is increasingly becoming a part of the K-12 educational landscape. While high schools with computer science teachers or technology coaches on staff are well positioned to help teachers integrate computational thinking into instruction, early childhood through middle schools (grades p-8) are often less well equipped. Further, the concept of CT is often poorly defined, especially as it relates to younger learners. Despite these challenges, teachers are being asked to integrate CT into other content lessons. To understand if and how this is happening, we conducted a statewide survey of primary (early childhood through middle school) Maryland teachers. The survey asked the teachers about their conceptualization of CT, CT resources they rely on, and their comfort levels to provide effective CT instruction for their students. The results of our survey demonstrate that teachers hold diverse views of the concept of CT and use a varied set of instructional resources in their classrooms. The contribution of this work is in helping advance our understanding of the current state of CT in primary classrooms.",10.1145/3287324.3287376,Association for Computing Machinery,18.0,ACM,,Technical Report,UK,Journal of Machine Learning Research

The content of the test is adapted from Baron-Cohen's picture story. We selected 5-7-year-old students (N=1234) from seven public schools in China for the test. The difficulty and distinguishing degree of each question were tested. Combined with the result of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), it is concluded that the sequence tests questions was composed of thirteen items, including three factors (amount, event and machine). Among them, four of the items that did not meet the standard were deleted. Our study also explored the differences of gender and age between 5-7-year-old students. The results show that the Sequencing Ability of girls is stronger than that of boys, and 7-year-old children may be the key period for the development of sequential ability.

In this poster session, the authors will introduce their research on developing Chinese elementary school students' computational thinking skill. The authors have developed a new information technology course with the focus on computational thinking. The research uses the convergent cognition theory as the theoretical framework. The convergent cognition theory posits that learning computer programming affects students' mathematical thinking and vice versa. The programming environment is Scratch. A group of third grade students and a group of fourth grade students are the participants. Their computational thinking skill and math ability will be measured to see whether this course develops students' computational thinking skill and whether convergent cognition effects exist.

Computational Thinking for All: An Experience Report on Scaling up Teaching Computational Thinking to All Students in a Major City in Sweden,"Heintz, Fredrik and Mannila, Linda",2018,"The Swedish government has recently introduced digital competence including programming in the Swedish K-9 curriculum starting no later than fall 2018. This means that 100 000 teachers need to learn programming and digital competence in less than a year. In this paper we report on our experience working with professional teacher training in Sweden's fifth largest city. The city has about 150 000 inhabitants and about 50 schools with about 14 000 students in primary education. The project has been carried out in close cooperation with the municipality.The work started in the fall of 2014 with a pilot study with 10 teachers in different subjects that was carried out during spring 2015. The pilot study was successful as the teachers were able to introduce activities related to programming and computational thinking in their subjects after only two half day workshops. The next step was to scale this up to include all the schools in the city. As expected, this turned out to be a larger challenge. More than 70 teachers were involved in the second part of the project. Some of the lessons learned are that it is quite easy to provide teacher training, but harder to get teachers to actually change their teaching and even more challenging to get teachers to help their colleagues introduce programming or computational thinking in their teaching.Based on our experience we draw some general conclusions and make suggestions for how to scale up the teaching of programming and computational thinking to all.",10.1145/3159450.3159586,Association for Computing Machinery,28.0,ACM,,Conference Proceedings,Germany,Journal of Machine Learning Research

Extending Computational Thinking into Information and Communication Technology Literacy Measurement: Gender and Grade Issues,"Kim, Han Sung and Kim, Soohwan and Na, Wooyoul and Lee, Woon Jee",2021,"As Information and Communication Technology (ICT) literacy education has recently shifted to fostering computing thinking ability as well as ICT use, many countries are conducting research on national curriculum and evaluation. In this study, we measured Korean students’ ICT literacy levels by using the national measurement tool that assesses abilities of the IT (Information Technology) area and the CT (Computational Thinking) area. A research team revised an existing ICT literacy assessment tool for the IT test and developed a new CT test environment in which students could perform actual coding through a web-based programming tool such as Scratch. Additionally, after assessing ICT literacy levels, differences in ICT literacy levels by gender and grade were analyzed to provide evidence for national education policies. Approximately 23,000 elementary and middle school students participated in the 2018 national assessment of ICT literacy, accounting for 1\% of the national population of students. The findings demonstrated that female students had higher literacy levels in most sub-factors of IT and CT areas. Additionally, in the areas of strengths and weaknesses, the ratio of below-basic achievement among male students was at least two times greater than that of female students. Nonetheless, male students scored higher on CT automation, a coding item that involved problem solving using Scratch. Looking at the difference according to grade level, the level improved as the school year increased in elementary school, but there was no difference in middle school. When analyzing the detailed elements of middle school students, the automation factor of seventh grade students was found to be higher than eighth and ninth grade students. Based on these results, this study discussed some implications for ICT and computing education in elementary and middle schools.",10.1145/3427596,Association for Computing Machinery,161.0,ACM,,Conference Proceedings,Mexico,Computers & Education

TACTOPI: a Playful Approach to Promote Computational Thinking for Visually Impaired Children,"Abreu, L\'{u}cia and Pires, Ana Cristina and Guerreiro, Tiago",2020,"The usage of playful activities is common in introductory programming settings. There is normally a virtual character or a physical robot that has to collect items or reach a goal within a map. Visually, these activities tend to be exciting enough to maintain children engaged: there is constant feedback about the actions being performed, and the virtual environments tend to be stimulating and aesthetically pleasant. Conversely, in adaptations for visually impaired children, these environments tend to become poorer, damaging the story at the cost of the programming actions and its dull mechanics (e.g., place a arrow block to move the character forward). In this paper, we present TACTOPI, a playful environment designed from the ground up to be rich in both its story (a nautical game) and its mechanics (e.g., a physical robot-boat controlled with a 3D printed wheel), tailored to promote computational thinking at different levels (4 to 8 years old).

Abstraction Through Multiple Representations in an Integrated Computational Thinking Environment,"Gautam, Aakash and Bortz, Whitney and Tatar, Deborah",2020,"We present reflections based on qualitative analysis of data from the CHEM+C Project which promotes computational thinking (CT) in classrooms through integration with science classes. The curriculum utilizes multiple representations, requiring students to work with physical phenomena, chemical equations, digital simulations, and modifiable code-based representations. Much CT focus on abstraction naturally emphasizes (1) extraction of a set of features from an object or process, and (2) finding commonality between objects and processes. But Rosen encourages us to think about abstraction as also including the production of new concepts or actions. Integrating CT into science offers the possibility of enhancing this aspect of abstraction. Changing the representational affordances available to the students allows them to take their CT thinking beyond learning-to-abstract towards learning-through-abstraction. This perspective moves computation from an internally focused exercise into the expression of valued ideas in a computational medium.",10.1145/3328778.3366892,Association for Computing Machinery,244.0,ACM,,Short Communication,Australia,Journal of Computer Science

Frame Shifting as a Challenge to Integrating Computational Thinking in Secondary Mathematics Education,"Huang, Wendy and Chan, Shiau Wei and Looi, Chee Kit",2021,"In this study, we adapted the notion of framing, a theoretical construct that refers to a person's expectations about social spaces (Goffman, 1974), to investigate whether teachers viewed computational thinking (CT) according to subject-specific frames. This case study aimed to understand how teachers make connections between CT and subjects targeted for integration. Epistemological framing contributed new insights on why teachers connected CT in different ways to different subjects: frame shifting focused teachers' attention on goals and activities specific to each subject. As teachers attended to a subject's particularities, they drew upon different epistemic resources to construct their descriptions of CT. Our participants (n=6) were teachers who taught both 7th-12th grade computing and mathematics as separate subjects. Qualitative coding of interview transcripts revealed that teachers' ideas about CT in computing were strongly influenced by computer programming while their ideas about CT in mathematics corresponded with familiar ways of teaching and learning mathematics. Instead of accepting fragmented notions of CT as the price of integration into individual subjects, we propose limiting the scope when defining CT. We explain how this non-intuitive strategy can preserve the coherence of CT and how it might be used in CT professional development (PD) for mathematics teachers.",10.1145/3408877.3432400,Association for Computing Machinery,92.0,ACM,,Technical Report,India,Computers & Education

Initial performance analysis in the evaluation of computational thinking from a gender perspective in higher education,"Rojas L\'{o}pez, Arturo and Garc\'{\i}a-Pe\~{n}alvo, Francisco Jos\'{e}",2021,"The computational thinking evaluation in last five years (2016-2020) has allowed to stablish a diagnosis for new students of Information Technologies division at the Universidad Tecnol\'{o}gica de Puebla – Mexico. The immediate benefit has been the offer of learning scenarios for the programming methodology course that impacts the retention indicator. Women and men have benefited from this strategy, but no review of the results had been conducted to determine whether there is any difference in evaluation performance from a gender perspective. As in other countries, in Mexico there is an accentuated percentage difference in terms of men´s election for higher education studies in areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. This article sets out the data analysis when evaluating five skills associated with the concept of computational thinking, this means, decomposition, abstraction, generalization, algorithmic design and evaluation. The conclusion of the analysis states that there is no significant gender difference in the results of evaluation.

Cross-grade Comparison of Computational Thinking in Young Children Using Normalized Unplugged Assessment Scores,"Relkin, Emily",2022,"The acquisition of Computational Thinking (CT) skills is an essential goal of Computer Science (CS) education. Assessment of CT is critical for CS teaching and research. However, there is a paucity of developmentally appropriate CT measures designed for early elementary school children. Among existing measures, there has been little attention paid to methods for comparing CT skills across grades. In the present study, I examined the use of a normalized scoring system for comparing performance on three grade-specific versions of the TechCheck CT assessment. TechCheck is a brief, unplugged, multiple-choice instrument for children 5-9 years of age that probes six domains of CT. Baseline raw score TechCheck data from 596 students showed normal distributions with significant differences in means between grades. I calculated Z-scores and percentile ranks by grade. This normalization allowed for the comparison of CT skills within and across grades in the context of a pilot longitudinal study of the CAL-ScratchJr coding curriculum. Application of the normative scoring system showed a difference in the outcome of only 4 percentile ranks between first and second graders while raw scores indicated an improbable 45\% difference. This study demonstrates that normalized TechCheck scores that take into account differences in the score distributions across grades can improve the measurement of CT skills in the context of early childhood CS educational interventions.",10.1145/3478432.3499214,Association for Computing Machinery,29.0,ACM,,Technical Report,Canada,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
Attractive Educational Robotics Motivates Younger Students to Learn Programming and Computational Thinking,"Jormanainen, Ilkka and Tukiainen, Markku",2021,"Educational robotics and physical computing have proved to be good sources of motivation for students of all ages and school levels. We conducted a series of workshops in the primary schools of city of Joensuu in eastern Finland, focusing on training the fundamental computational thinking (CT) skills by using a programmable and interactive Teddy Bear toy. Educational robotics and physical computing devices have proved to be an efficient way to teach these skills regardless the students’ age group or previous background. To assess the students’ intrinsic motivation towards Teddy Bear programming, we devised a survey for workshop participants and conducted a statistical analysis to compare differences between the genders and age groups. The results of the large-scale empirical study (n=1440) show that the students at the age of 9-10 years (Grades 3-4) are significantly more motivated towards such a learning tool than the students of age 11-12 years (Grades 5-6). Furthermore, we show that especially young girls find the Teddy Bear programming motivating and they are eager to learn more.

Fostering Computational Thinking through Problem-Solving at School,"Labusch, Amelie",2018,"Computational thinking has recently gained more and more relevance as problem-solving competence of the 21st century. Taking Wing's [1] grand vision into account, each student should have certain skills in computational thinking in order to be able to participate adequately in social life and in his/her future profession. Thus, the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS 2018) does in addition to other student competences also measure their achievement in computational thinking [2]. In this internationally comparative large-scale assessment with a representative sample, a sound body of information is gathered that is used, among others, to explain variation in students' achievement in computational thinking. One field that represents a national extension in Germany is problem-solving.

These earlier phases are, however, important to let children meet open-ended problems, brainstorm solutions and ideate their own creative designs. In this paper we present a model for an online, scalable and scaffolded design workshop for covering such aspects at K-12 level. Through a case study with 1200 students and 60 teachers on IoT and smart things, we describe the workshop and the resulting designs. While the students managed to design their own artifacts, more time had been needed for covering ethical aspects related to technology design. The results suggest creating separate workshops for different grade levels, and also for design and ethical aspects respectively. Moreover, additional resources could support teachers in continuing the discussion with the students after the workshop.",10.1145/3585088.3589377,Association for Computing Machinery,81.0,ACM,,Research Article,USA,Nature Communications

Algorithmic thinking (AT) and generalization are two key elements of CT that are often underrepresented in traditional mathematics lessons. This study investigated how to address AT and generalization aspects in 12th-grade calculus lessons using the dynamic mathematics software GeoGebra. We present a six-lesson intervention designed by an interdisciplinary team of researchers and teachers with a background in computer science and mathematics education that aims to foster pre-university students’ AT and generalization skills in calculus lessons. We evaluated the intervention in a 15 students classroom in the Netherlands through the analysis of students’ workbooks, files, interviews, and the teacher’s logbook. The findings suggest that the intervention was favorably seen by both the teacher and the students, and that their learning and teaching experience was highly satisfactory. The most common challenges for successfully completing the designed material included issues related to getting familiar with GeoGebra, syntax, and effectively using conditional statements.

Testing a design-based learning approach to enhance elementary students’ computational thinking with experience-sampling method,"Li, Xing and Zhang, Yi and Huang, Jing",2022,"Computational Thinking (CT) is regarded as a key competency for k-12 children in the 21st century. In this project, a design-based learning (DBL) approach was proposed to improve elementary school students’ CT. This approach included programming skills learning and STEM practices with authentic real-life contexts. We assessed CT in a more accurate manner with experience-sampling methodology (ESM). A quasi-experiment study was carried out to assess how the intervention was associated with students’ self-perceived CT skills using event-based experience-sampling methodology. Forty sixth graders engaged in the curriculum units to create artifacts that solve specific real-world problems using Arduino electronic kits and Mind+ programming software. Results revealed that students’ self-perceived CT skills increased to a greater extent statistically. Using the experience sampling method, students’ self-perceived CT skills has different fluctuations in different stages of DBL, at the third phase of designing artifact, there is a significant decrease because learners are unfamiliar at the beginning of complicated cooperation in depth, which is likely to produce discourse conflicts and reduce efficiency. With the intervention of teachers, learners begin to improve greatly in the later stage. Learners have the highest CT in the iteration and improvement phases of prototype making and the final demonstration stage. In addition, collaboration plays an extremely important role in DBL, especially in the design phase. This study contributes to research in DBL teaching approach, CT instruction, its application in STEM education in particular, and how it can be used in elementary level education in general.",10.1145/3488838.3488842,Association for Computing Machinery,150.0,ACM,,Short Communication,Canada,Computers & Education
What Do We Know about Assessing Computational Thinking? A New Methodological Perspective from the Literature,"Liu, Ruohan and Luo, Feiya and Israel, Maya",2021,"Developing computational thinking (CT) assessment methods appropriate for elementary students is attracting growing attention as CT research in elementary education progresses. To review the current elementary CT assessments for potential gaps, and seek additional methodologies to expand our understanding of CT, an integrative literature review of 75 research papers was performed in two phases. In Phase One, we conducted a critical analysis of existing elementary CT assessment studies. Key results include: 1) Artifact analysis, CT assessment items, and interviews are the most common methods utilized to assess CT in elementary grades; 2) Existing CT assessments primarily focus on students' computational artifacts and performance on CT tests; however, strategies to study students' thought processes during CT problem-solving are limited and under-utilized. Guided by the results of phase one, along with the theoretical perspective that connected CT to visual processing ability, in phase two we performed a survey of literature in the area of understanding cognitive processes through eye-tracking (i.e., visual attention) and think-aloud methodologies (i.e., verbalization). We focused on eye-tracking and think-aloud methodologies as these have been used to understand students' cognitive processes during problem-solving in other areas.

Exploring How Game Genre in Student-Designed Games Influences Computational Thinking Development,"Troiano, Giovanni Maria and Chen, Qinyu and Alba, \'{A}ngela Vargas and Robles, Gregorio and Smith, Gillian and Cassidy, Michael and Tucker-Raymond, Eli and Puttick, Gillian and Harteveld, Casper",2020,"Game design is increasingly used in modern education to foster Computational Thinking (CT). Yet, it is unclear how and if the game genre of student-designed games impact CT and programming. We explore how game genre impacts CT development and programming routines in Scratch games designed by 8th-grade students using a metrics-based approach (i.e., Dr. Scratch). Our findings show that designing particular games (e.g., action, storytelling) impact CT and programming development. We observe, for instance, that CT skills develop and consolidate fast, after which students can focus on aspects more specific to game design. Based on the results, we suggest that researchers and educators in constructionist learning consider the impact of game genre when designing game-based curricula for the learning of programming and CT.",10.1145/3313831.3376755,Association for Computing Machinery,215.0,ACM,,Editorial,Canada,PLOS ONE
"Changing Teacher Perceptions about Computational Thinking in Grades 1-6, through a National Training Program","Simmonds, Jocelyn and Gutierrez, Francisco J. and Meza, Federico and Torrent, Catalina and Villalobos, Jaime",2021,"Chile is a medium-sized developing country, with approximately 3,500,000 school-aged children. Computational thinking (CT) has been recognized as a tool for developing XXI century skills, but Chile has a large population of in-service teachers that do not know what CT is, limiting its application in classrooms. In response, the government has enacted a training program for in-service primary school teachers, focusing on changing their perceptions about CT, and showing them how it can be used in classroom. This training program was designed for grades 1-6 and piloted in the capital region during 2018. The program initially focused on coding activities, but was then redesigned to show how CT can be used to help meet the learning objectives of different subjects in the curriculum. The program was then scaled up nationwide. In this experience report, we discuss the outcomes of this program. The training program scaled as intended and we identified positive changes in teacher perceptions about CT, especially among female participants. We conclude with the lessons we learned from this experience.",10.1145/3408877.3432542,Association for Computing Machinery,33.0,ACM,,Editorial,Chile,Science Advances
Design of Social Story Teaching Aid for Autistic Children Based on Computational Thinking and Its Case Study,"Li, Xin-Zhu and Chen, Chun-Ching and Kang, Xin",2021,"Computational thinking is an emerging teaching strategy as well as an ability necessary for all people in the future. In this study, social stories are used to teach autistic children social skills. Combining sequential computational thinking as a learning strategy and applying Conductive Copper Foil Tape and Makey Makey, a social story teaching aid is made. With the help of it, children can learn the content from social stories, learn social stories through computational thinking and arrange corresponding sequence structure. Three autistic children from Grade 1 took part in six teaching experiments and were observed their change of social skills. The results showed that scientific teaching aid could improve autistic children's social ability, speaking skills, attention, and learning interests, making them observe the storytelling more carefully and easily, understand the story development, and learn social skills from it. Besides, this teaching aid could improve autistic children's social reciprocity and provide theoretical references for relevant fields.",10.1145/3468691.3468712,Association for Computing Machinery,227.0,ACM,,Research Article,India,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering

Computational Thinking in the Making: Lessons for Second Graders in a STEM Computer Science Immersion School,"Scheppegrell, Lindsey and Hiatt, Elyse and Okerlund, Johanna and Wilson, David",2019,"Recently, there has been significant interest in integrating Maker-related experiences into formal education. A challenge is reconciling open-ended making and non-deterministic learning goals with standards that drive traditional education. In the context of our CS-focused STEM magnet school, we designed two 2nd grade lessons that not only align with grade-level standards and our school's computer science-oriented pedagogy, but also incorporate 3D printing and the philosophy of Makerspaces. The integrated Maker experience serves to scaffold computational thinking practices such as abstraction, modeling, and decomposition, which are essential for long-term success in STEM learning. To bring these aspects together, we created a rubric based on existing evaluation tools. Using this rubric, we evaluated the two lessons with a small sample of participants. Our pilot study shows promise of mastery in standard-related content, evidence of a making mindset, engagement in the activity, innovation in design, and solidarity in working with peers. Aligning state standards with open-ended Maker activities has potential for fostering student growth and engagement in the classroom. An additional component of our research was reflecting on our experience as teachers with no Makerspace experience who were newly submerged in the digital fabrication world. We present the two 3D printing-based lessons, one addressing extreme weather standards, the other incorporating understanding of urban, suburban, and rural communities. We also present the rubric we designed, the literature that guided this work, and reflections and recommendations from our experience of learning digital fabrication for the first time and integrating it into curriculum.",10.1145/3287324.3293833,Association for Computing Machinery,211.0,ACM,,Conference Proceedings,France,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering

Does computational thinking correlate with personality? the non-cognitive side of computational thinking,"Rom\'{a}n-Gonz\'{a}lez, Marcos and P\'{e}rez-Gonz\'{a}lez, Juan-Carlos and Moreno-Le\'{o}n, Jes\'{u}s and Robles, Gregorio",2016,"Computational thinking (CT) is being considered as a key set of problem-solving skills to be acquired by the new generations of digital citizens and workers in order to thrive in a computer-based world. However, from a psychometric point of view, CT is still a poorly defined psychological construct: there is no full consensus on a formal definition of CT or how to measure it; and its correlations with other psychological constructs, whether cognitive or non-cognitive, have not been completely established. In response to the latter, this paper aims to study specifically the correlations between CT and the several dimensions from the 'Big Five' model of human personality: Conscientiousness, Openness to Experience, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. To do so, the Computational Thinking Test (CTt) and the Big Five Questionnaire-Children version (BFQ-C) are administered on a sample (n = 99) of Spanish students from 5th to 10th grade. Results show statistically significant correlations between CT and: Openness to Experience (r = 0.41), Extraversion (r = 0.30), and Conscientiousness (r = 0.27). These results are partially consistent with the literature about the links between cognitive and personality variables, and corroborate the existence of a non-cognitive side of CT. Hence, educational interventions aimed at fostering CT should take into account these non-cognitive issues in order to be comprehensive and successful.",10.1145/3012430.3012496,Association for Computing Machinery,195.0,ACM,,Technical Report,Argentina,Nature Communications

Embracing coding mistakes to teach computational thinking,"Harrison, W. Scott and Hanebutte, Nadine",2018,"In this paper, we argue for a pedagogical approach of embracing ""mistakes"" as an effective teaching tool for coding. This technique of teaching uses mistakes as a learning tool to teach computational thinking. Instead of simply showing and explaining correct solutions, code with logical errors is presented to the class. After verifying the code does not work, the class as a whole, becomes engaged in trying to correct the logical errors in code presented to the class. In this paper, we reference the Student Query Directed Learning approach which we map into our techniques. We present a transcript of a lecture one of the authors has given using this technique to illustrate motivations, how to steer the conversation where we want it to go, and student/instructor interactions. Finally, we suggest some ""ground rules"" to ensure this environment is all-encompassing and one which is conducive to learning.",,Consortium for Computing Sciences in Colleges,60.0,ACM,,Conference Proceedings,Canada,Science Advances

Introducing Middle School Students to Computational Thinking with the CS First Curriculum,"Beason, Kara and Fenwick, James B. and Norris, Cindy",2020,"Computational thinking (CT) is a set of concepts and problem-solving skills that are not only imperative for computer scientists, but important and applicable to nearly every discipline. CT skills are essential in a world where technology is ubiquitous. In the past decade, many efforts have been made to develop and evaluate computational thinking in primary and secondary students. Promoting CT skills in these young students can help reduce the underrepresentation of women and minorities in STEM careers since students who are exposed to CT at an early age are more likely to pursue a STEM discipline in college [18].This paper describes the COSMIC program, funded by Google's Tides Foundation, that introduces middle school students to CS and CT using the CS First curriculum and Scratch. The COSMIC activities spanned three years directly serving 700 students through 175 distinct events. Females comprised 51.1\% of the individuals served, and 10.2\% of those served were part of a minority group. The COSMIC activities allowed the researchers to investigate the effectiveness of the CS First curriculum.

The long quest for computational thinking,"Tedre, Matti and Denning, Peter J.",2016,"Computational thinking (CT) is a popular phrase that refers to a collection of computational ideas and habits of mind that people in computing disciplines acquire through their work in designing programs, software, simulations, and computations performed by machinery. Recently a computational thinking for K-12 movement has spawned initiatives across the education sector, and educational reforms are under way in many countries. However, modern CT initiatives should be well aware of the broad and deep history of computational thinking, or risk repeating already refuted claims, past mistakes, and already solved problems, or losing some of the richest and most ambitious ideas in CT. This paper presents an overview of three important historical currents from which CT has developed: evolution of computing's disciplinary ways of thinking and practicing, educational research and efforts in computing, and emergence of computational science and digitalization of society. The paper examines a number of threats to CT initiatives: lack of ambition, dogmatism, knowing versus doing, exaggerated claims, narrow views of computing, overemphasis on formulation, and lost sight of computational models.",10.1145/2999541.2999542,Association for Computing Machinery,146.0,ACM,,Research Article,USA,Journal of Computer Science
Improving Computational Thinking Using Follow and Give Instructions,"Figueiredo, Jos\'{e} and Garc\'{\i}a-Pe\~{n}alvo, Francisco J.",2017,"Computational Thinking can be defined as a set of skills for problem solving based on Computer Science. Computational Thinking skills are not only limited to the field of computing but also extensible to all areas of knowledge. Young people grow up surrounded by technology but many of them go for university without any prior knowledge in computer science. Several initiatives have been created to promote Computational Thinking abilities in students all over the world. Teaching computational thinking must necessarily involve problem-solving, and can be applied to various types of problems that do not directly involve coding tasks. However, it is recognized to everyone that programming is a good way to improve Computational Thinking. In this article, we have done a survey on the existing tools that use the codification as main means of development of the abilities of computational thinking or not. It was also a concern to mention those that provide a wide variety of resources for teachers.

However, research is needed to inform high-school teachers how to foster students' development of CT in computer science and other subjects. Evidence suggests that agent-based modeling is a valuable way for students to learn CT in different subjects. This paper reports a teaching experiment where researchers, developers, and high school teachers collaborated to develop six NetLogo models. The models were used in nine Danish High Schools in the following four subjects: Biotechnology, chemistry, biology, and social science. Teachers and students had no or very limited experience with programming. Students build CT and content knowledge by using, modifying, and creating code in the models. This paper provides details for others to adopt the models and the underlying CMC framework, which integrates: Coding, Modeling, and Content. The paper evaluates the results from an open-ended questionnaire with all participating students (n=210) and semi-structured interviews with all teachers (n=15).

However, there is a strong gender gap in the field of science and technology due to the influence of the male-centered culture that persists today. Computational thinking is presented as a way to develop in children from an early age the ability to solve problems, designing systems and understanding human behavior while using the fundamental concepts of computing. This factor allows girls to be in touch with technology in a fun and meaningful way; so as to balance the male and female presence in science and technology, achieving a more egalitarian system. In this article is presented a systematic review of the literature which indicates that few studies about computational thinking are working from a gender perspective, although some countries have already opted for teaching computer in the classroom. In addition, the review shows some methodologies which are using languages and suitable tools in order to work the computational thinking.

Extending and Evaluating the Use-Modify-Create Progression for Engaging Youth in Computational Thinking,"Martin, Fred and Lee, Irene and Lytle, Nicholas and Sentance, Sue and Lao, Natalie",2020,"The Use-Modify-Create progression (UMC) was conceptualized in 2011 after comparing the productive integration of computational thinking across National Science Foundation-funded Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (NSF ITEST) programs. Since that time, UMC has been widely promoted as a means to scaffold student learning of computational thinking (CT) while enabling personalization and allowing for creative adaptations of pre-existing computational artifacts. In addition to UMC's continued application, it has recently been utilized to scaffold student learning in topics as diverse as machine learning, e-textiles, and computer programming. UMC has also been applied to instructional goals other than ""supporting students in becoming creators of computational artifacts."" This panel will re-examine the UMC progression and refine our understanding of when its use is suitable, and when not, and share findings on evaluations and extensions to UMC that are productive in new and different contexts.",10.1145/3328778.3366971,Association for Computing Machinery,16.0,ACM,,Technical Report,China,Nature Communications
Introducing Computational Thinking through Non-Programming Science Activities,"Ouyang, Youwen and Hayden, Katherine L. and Remold, Julie",2018,"Many programs offer informal experiences in programming for select students who may qualify or whose parents pay fees for attending. Integrating computational thinking (CT) in the formal classroom setting provides equal opportunities to develop valuable problem-solving skills for all students. However, such integration poses challenges since teachers may have limited experiences in computing and may be pressured by time constraints due to the need to cover Common Core and Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) as well as district specific initiatives. A 2-year intervention has been designed to target upper elementary level self-contained classrooms to increase teachers' knowledge and ability for integrating CT into science lessons. Twenty teachers from four school districts in Southern California participated in the first year of the project's professional development activities. These schools have varying levels of diversity and socioeconomic status of student populations. Instead of using popular drag-and-drop programming tools such as Scratch or Tynker, the first year of the project focused on key CT concepts and helped teachers connect these concepts with skills important for student success in science activities. This paper reports on the study of the project's impact on student learning of key CT concepts among students from project classrooms. The main elements of the professional development are also described.",10.1145/3159450.3159520,Association for Computing Machinery,195.0,ACM,,Review Paper,France,Computers & Education
Analysis of the relationship between computational thinking and mathematical abstraction in primary education,"Chaabi, Hasnaa and Azmani, Amina and Dodero, Juan Manuel",2019,The aim of this paper is to broaden our view on the relationship between Computational Thinking and the development of the abstraction skill applied to mathematics. It was aimed to reveal trends and new potential solutions to be explored in the teaching of mathematics. We carefully selected sixty-four papers related with the objective above cited. From which we inspected twenty-four discovering that abstraction is a key skill for mathematics and Computational Thinking. We also discovered that we need to define which type of abstraction are we going to work on together with choosing between the two ways of teaching CT: integrating it to the curricula or as an after-school program.,10.1145/3362789.3362881,Association for Computing Machinery,4.0,ACM,,Research Article,Japan,Computers & Education
Recognizing Possibilities of Computational Thinking When Teaching First-degree Equations: A Classroom Case,"Barbosa, Luciana Leal da Silva and Maltempi, Marcus Vinicius",2019,"This work aims to present a hands-on activity for the first degree equations. The activity was applied to a reinforcement class of the K-8, in a public school in Birigui, S\~{a}o Paulo, Brazil. The activity used the Balance of Equations game, built on the Scratch programming environment with the objective of teaching the initial ideas of first degree equations to a class with a learning gap in this discipline. The planning of the activity was divided into three moments, with the intention of starting from an analogy to the principle of equivalence of an equation, reaching the algebraic transcription of an equation through activities of manipulation of the game code. Seven concepts related to computational thinking with strong potential to be worked during the activity were identified. In this way, besides the presentation of the classroom case, this article identifies these seven concepts, analyzing how they could be developed during the application of the activity, seeking to answer the following question: How can computational thinking skills be explored through hands-on activity for the teaching of equations?",10.1145/3311890.3311898,Association for Computing Machinery,71.0,ACM,,Research Article,Germany,Journal of Computer Science

Improving Assessment of Computational Thinking Through a Comprehensive Framework,"Basso, Demis and Fronza, Ilenia and Colombi, Alessandro and Pahl, Claus",2018,"In recent years, Computational Thinking (CT) made its way into K-12 as a key set of 21st-century skills. However, the issue of assessing student's learning of CT remains a challenging one: it is indeed not clear how to achieve a comprehensive evaluation that is able to assess not only the technical and domain-specific skills, but also the domain-independent meta-skills of CT. Finding a solution to this issue is crucial, because assessment not only determines whether or not educational goals are being met, but also supports the design of a curriculum. Multiple forms of assessments have been proposed within the main perspective of programming skills, neglecting the possible generalization of CT training on other skills. In this work, we first review the existing approaches to CT assessment. Then, we discuss what non-technical skills (relational skills and cognitive life-skills) should be included in a comprehensive CT assessment framework. Moreover, we provide an indication of possible solutions to capitalize on the existing experiences in order to achieve a feasible integration of different types of assessment.",10.1145/3279720.3279735,Association for Computing Machinery,198.0,ACM,,Case Study,UK,Nature Communications
Analysis of Collaborative Learning in a Computational Thinking Class,"Chowdhury, Bushra and Bart, Austin Cory and Kafura, Dennis",2018,"Collaborative learning can help reduce the anxiety level of learners, improve understanding and thus create a positive atmosphere for learning. This study analyzes students' collaborative learning experiences within small interdisciplinary ""cohorts"" while learning computational thinking in a university-level class. The cohort allows students from different disciplines to contribute diverse perspectives, socially interact with each other and in turn create situations where two or more students learn together. This study uses both qualitative and quantitative means to explore students' collaborative learning experiences. Ethnographically-informed qualitative data using Stahl's collaborative framework is analyzed. The analysis revealed that most students found the cohort model to be valuable in learning computational thinking by allowing them to ask about and explain problems, especially with students from different disciplines who perceive and explain a problem differently. Quantitative data from a multi-term survey complements and confirms the findings from the qualitative data.

It is in fact that most research work in Computation Thinking have served for students but much less for teachers. College teachers in China took less systematic training in order to adequately prepare them for increasingly higher teaching requirements. To address this issue, this paper first proposes an outcomes-based teacher education program distinguished from CT principles under teaching and learning perspective, decomposed an abstract computational thinking idea into a definite coursework content.

A Teacher Workshop for Introducing Computational Thinking in Rural and Vulnerable Environments,"Simmonds, Jocelyn and Gutierrez, Francisco J. and Casanova, Cecilia and Sotomayor, Cecilia and Hitschfeld, Nancy",2019,"In Latin America, computational thinking workshops are mostly developed in urban areas, charging participation fees. And although teachers are increasingly being expected to include technology in their classrooms, computational thinking and programming are not mandatory topics in teacher training programs. This hinders the development of digital skills among Latino students, and we expect that the digital gap between urban and rural populations will expand over time, especially in socio-economically vulnerable populations. Believing that teachers can be agents of change, we designed a 12 hour workshop to train the K-8 teaching staff in a rural and vulnerable school. The goal of this experience was to help these teachers develop basic computational thinking skills and devise new ways to incorporate what they learned in their classrooms. In this paper, we report our experience facilitating this workshop, and analyze the teacher perceptions before and after the intervention. Teacher attitudes changed drastically during the execution of the workshop, and they were able to come up with creative ways of incorporating computational thinking activities into their subjects. The reported experience can be used as input to develop public policies with respect to how computational thinking should be introduced in rural and vulnerable environments.",10.1145/3287324.3287456,Association for Computing Machinery,53.0,ACM,,Conference Proceedings,Spain,PLOS ONE
Developing Computational Thinking through a Virtual Robotics Programming Curriculum,"Witherspoon, Eben B. and Higashi, Ross M. and Schunn, Christian D. and Baehr, Emily C. and Shoop, Robin",2017,"Computational thinking describes key principles from computer science that are broadly generalizable. Robotics programs can be engaging learning environments for acquiring core computational thinking competencies. However, few empirical studies evaluate the effectiveness of a robotics programming curriculum for developing computational thinking knowledge and skills. This study measures pre/post gains with new computational thinking assessments given to middle school students who participated in a virtual robotics programming curriculum. Overall, participation in the virtual robotics curriculum was related to significant gains in pre- to posttest scores, with larger gains for students who made further progress through the curriculum. The success of this intervention suggests that participation in a scaffolded programming curriculum, within the context of virtual robotics, supports the development of generalizable computational thinking knowledge and skills that are associated with increased problem-solving performance on nonrobotics computing tasks. Furthermore, the particular units that students engage in may determine their level of growth in these competencies.",10.1145/3104982,Association for Computing Machinery,149.0,ACM,,Editorial,Japan,Nature Communications
Assessing Middle School Students' Computational Thinking Through Programming Trajectory Analysis,"Akram, Bita and Min, Wookhee and Wiebe, Eric and Mott, Bradford and Boyer, Kristy Elizabeth and Lester, James",2019,"With national K-12 education initiatives such as ""CSForAll,"" block-based programming environments have emerged as widely used tools for teaching novice programming. A key challenge presented by block-based programming environments is assessing students' computational thinking (CT) and programming competencies. Developing assessment methods that can evaluate students' use of CT practices such as testing and refining, and developing and using appropriate algorithms, can help teachers evaluate students learning and provide appropriate scaffolding. In this work, we utilize an evidence-centered assessment design approach to devise a three-dimensional assessment to evaluate students' CT competencies based on evidence extracted from their programming trajectories in a block-based programming environment. In this assessment, the first dimension assesses students' knowledge of essential CT concepts, the second dimension assesses students' dynamic testing and refining strategies, and the third dimension assesses their overall problem-solving efficiency. We apply the assessment framework to data collected from students' interactions with a game-based learning environment designed to develop middle-grade students' CT competencies and programming skills. The results demonstrate that students' knowledge of basic CT constructs, such as appropriate use and combination of control structures, serves as the foundation for designing and implementing effective algorithms. Further, we assessed students testing and refining strategies over the three dimensions of novelty, positivity, and scale. The results demonstrate that students with higher algorithmic capabilities tend to make more novel, positive, and small-scale changes. The results reveal distinctive patterns in students' approaches to computational thinking problem solving and make a step toward identifying and assessing productive computational thinking practices.",10.1145/3287324.3293798,Association for Computing Machinery,95.0,ACM,,Review Paper,Japan,ACM Transactions on Graphics
How Many Abilities Can We Measure in Computational Thinking? A Study on Bebras Challenge,"Araujo, Ana Liz Souto O. and Andrade, Wilkerson L. and Guerrero, Dalton D. Serey and Melo, Monilly Ramos Araujo",2019,"While several approaches have been proposed to assess computational thinking (CT) abilities, it is still unclear how many and which these abilities are. Despite the undisputed importance of assessment, the fact is that there is not enough evidence on which abilities are merely theoretical and which can be empirically observed in the context of CT. This paper is part of a larger investigation in which we try to answer a simple question: can CT abilities be quantitatively defined and measured? In this particular study, we try to answer a simple question: How many CT abilities can be empirically observed using factor analysis? We approach this question, using a dataset containing answers of 1564 students from Lithuania in the Bebras Challenge from 2015. Firstly, we used confirmatory factor analysis to verify a theory that claims that five CT abilities are assessed by the contest. Our analysis shows the theory is not statistically supported. Secondly, we used principal component analysis as an exploratory analysis to try to derive an appropriate number of factors from the data. Surprisingly, the analysis suggests there are only two main recognizable factors. Finally, we briefly discuss these factors and hypothesize that the first is called evaluation ability, which would include abstraction, generalization, and decomposition, while factor 2 is algorithmic thinking and logical reasoning.",10.1145/3287324.3287405,Association for Computing Machinery,105.0,ACM,,Editorial,Australia,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering

The coursework and feedback from the MOOC course indicate that they readily associate computational thinking with problem solving in math.

From computational thinking to coding and back,"DePryck, Koen",2016,"Introducing coding in the curriculum at an early age is considered a long term investment in bridging the skills gap between the technology demands of the labour market and the availability of people to fill them. The keys to success include moving from mere literacy to active control - not only at the level of learners but also at the level of teachers. However, given the fast development of the field, one might wonder whether acquiring specific coding skills really is the essence of introducing coding early in the curriculum. We argue that the reach of ICT -including coding skills- is much broader than STEM alone and a background in STEM is no longer a requirement for successful coding. The complex link between coding and computational thinking is the real critical success factor.

Computational Thinking as a Liberal Study,"Mason, Dave and Khan, Irfan and Farafontov, Vadim",2016,"Computers and computational thinking are becoming ubiquitous in our world. They are part of the transportation systems we use, the security systems we confront, our entertainment systems, our communication systems, our financial systems, and even our social and political instruments. Computational thinking is a fundamental part of decision-making on a large and increasing number of fronts. It is sometimes hard for a computer scientist to imagine how people without access to those tools can navigate the world in an informed way.We have designed a course to bring the social, historical, cultural and technical context of these systems to the attention of students and citizens who would not otherwise have access to them, so they can better understand the world in which they will live and work. The course is a Computer Science course because it is talking about the science of computers, albeit in an approachable form for an audience without any assumed previous programming experience.The course ran in Winter 2014 and Winter 2015 meeting most of its goals, including engaging the non-traditional student who took it.",10.1145/2839509.2844655,Association for Computing Machinery,105.0,ACM,,Case Study,Mexico,Journal of Computer Science

Establishing Computational Thinking as Just Another Tool in the Problem Solving Tool Box,"Fleenor, Hillary",2019,"Even though the computer science education community has not definitively established exactly what ?Computational Thinking"" entails, most will agree that it is using a computing machine to solve problems. Like all tools for solving problems, this knowledge should be made available to everyone. Jeannette Wing sounded this call in 2006, writing that ""computational methods and models give us the courage to solve problems and design systems that no one of us would be capable of tackling alone."" These skills are not just for computer scientists, but for anyone and everyone who plans to solve problems. We already teach other forms of problem solving to all our students including: Mathematical Thinking, Critical Thinking, and Scientific Reasoning. Computational Thinking, as well as engineering and design's Design Thinking, should be equally exposed to all students. It is also important to illuminate that these tools are not used in isolation to solve problems. Perhaps the key to the acceptance of Computational Thinking (as well as Design Thinking) as essential educational tools is to highlight their overlap and interdependence with other problem solving skills. The next generation will need practice with every tool at their disposal to be prepared to solve tomorrow's problems. I propose embedding Computational Thinking in a problem solving framework that leverages teachers' (and students') existing knowledge of problem solving in mathematics, science, and language arts in order to encourage teachers in non CS disciplines to teach Computational Thinking in their classrooms.",10.1145/3287324.3293792,Association for Computing Machinery,244.0,ACM,,Conference Proceedings,Japan,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering

Exploring the Definition of Computational Thinking in Research and the Classroom,"Lowe, Tony and Brophy, Sean and Cardella, Monica",2019,"Our research group has studied how Kindergarteners through second graders can be introduced to the ideas of Computational Thinking (CT) through engineer design, unplugged, and programming activities. We often found it difficult to explain the boundaries and clear definitions for CT in research, to students and their teachers. Literature provides a variety of definitions from various perspectives, but these definitions often seem like capturing smoke. We see evidence CT, indicating fire, but how hot or lasting it burns cannot be measured by smoke alone. CT is typically defined by siloed concepts and skills. Some silos describe concrete ideas, which tend to be tied to programming principles. Many describe essential ideas, but over generalized becoming hard to teach and measure and distinguish from other types of problem solving. Is there a middle ground where we can clearly observe the presence and growing maturing of CT yet not limit the ways it can manifest, particularly without requiring coding? We hope this poster inspires conversation on 1.) the intersection of CT and programming skills, 2.) the priority and order for learning those skills, and 3.) how we can promote CT in disciplines who interact with and help define computational solutions yet are never expected to learn to program.

Using Cultural Responsiveness to Elicit Computational Thinking in Maker Environments: (Abstract Only),"Hadad, Roxana and Hausman Jacobson, C. Meghan and Thomas, Kate and Sol\'{o}rzano, Germania and Kachovska, Mila and Yin, Yue",2018,"Work in culturally responsive pedagogy and culturally responsive computing (CRC)(Scott, et al., 2014) holds promise for how to include underrepresented students into making communities as they develop their computational thinking (CT) skills. Cultural responsiveness involves instructors using what they know about students' individual identities to develop learning opportunities; having high expectations; and understanding students' sociopolitical contexts (Ladson-Billings, 1995). By integrating these approaches, students encounter a makerspace without pre-determined cultural norms that encourages questioning assumptions that limit the development of inclusive technology. This poster explores preliminary results from a mixed methods multiple case study. Sixteen high school students participated in a two-week summer making program that focused on CT and physics skills. Students shared elements of their identities, brought in artifacts for ""show and tell"", collected data on how they spend their time, and categorized assets in their communities to then incorporate into their own projects. Researchers analyzed classroom observations, videos, interviews, and student notebooks, as well as students' pre-post tests and attitudinal surveys. Findings reflect the importance of valuing student identity, building community, and highlighting how CT and physics affect students' lives.

"Computational Thinking in Italian Schools: Quantitative Data and Teachers' Sentiment Analysis after Two Years of ""Programma il Futuro""","Corradini, Isabella and Lodi, Michael and Nardelli, Enrico",2017,"In this paper the first two years of activities of ""Programma il Futuro"" project are described. Its goal is to disseminate among teachers in Italian primary and secondary schools a better awareness of informatics as the scientific basis of digital technologies. The project has adapted Code.org learning material and has introduced it to Italian schools with the support of a dedicated web site. Response has been enthusiastic in terms of participation: in two years more than one million students have been engaged and have completed a total of 10 million hours of informatics in schools. Almost all students found the material useful and were interested, teachers have reported. They have also declared to have experienced high satisfaction and a low level of difficulty. A detailed analysis of quantitative and qualitative data about the project is presented and areas for improvement are identified. One of the most interesting observations appears to corroborate the hypothesis that an exposure to informatics since the early age is important to attract students independently from their gender.",10.1145/3059009.3059040,Association for Computing Machinery,208.0,ACM,,Conference Proceedings,India,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering
Development of Computational Thinking Skills through Unplugged Activities in Primary School,"Brackmann, Christian P. and Rom\'{a}n-Gonz\'{a}lez, Marcos and Robles, Gregorio and Moreno-Le\'{o}n, Jes\'{u}s and Casali, Ana and Barone, Dante",2017,"Computational thinking is nowadays being widely adopted and investigated. Educators and researchers are using two main approaches to teach these skills in schools: with computer programming exercises, and with unplugged activities that do not require the use of digital devices or any kind of specific hardware. While the former is the mainstream approach, the latter is especially important for schools that do not have proper technology resources, Internet connections or even electrical power. However, there is a lack of investigations that prove the effectiveness of the unplugged activities in the development of computational thinking skills, particularly for primary schools. This paper, which summarizes a quasi-experiment carried out in two primary schools in Spain, tries to shed some light on this regard. The results show that students in the experimental groups, who took part in the unplugged activities, enhanced their computational thinking skills significantly more than their peers in the control groups who did not participate during the classes, proving that the unplugged approach may be effective for the development of this ability.",10.1145/3137065.3137069,Association for Computing Machinery,12.0,ACM,,Editorial,Mexico,PLOS ONE

Teaching Computational Thinking Through Bio-Design (Abstract Only),"Okerlund, Johanna and Shaer, Orit and Latulipe, Celine",2016,"We are developing ways to teach computational thinking through interaction with tangible digital tools for synthetic biology. Inspired in part by Jeannette Wing's (Wing 2008) notion of the essence and pervasiveness of computational thinking, a growing community within SIGCSE is exploring tools that encourage computational thinking that don't use traditional computer science terminology or computer programming (Basawapna 2013, Daily 2014, Freeman 2014, Miller 2014, Wolz 2011). However, that community has not yet explored how to teach computational thinking through bio-design. Synthetic biology is a relatively new research field where scientists engineer living organisms to exhibit new behaviors. Biologists arrange and combine BioBricks, sequences of DNA that exhibit a behavior, sense an environmental factor, or indicate the beginning or end of a larger sequence. Bio-design not only incorporates traditional principles of computational thinking (abstraction, modularity, design/build/test), but also introduces new challenges that force the user to apply these principles in new ways. Interacting with biology can thus 1) help deepen understanding for people who are proficient in computational thinking, 2) provide a platform for introduction to computational thinking for the first time. Because most bio-design is performed in a wetlab by experienced biologists, we focus now on designing and developing low-barrier digital tools for interacting with biology. We present SynFlo (Okerlund 2016), a tangible interactive system for bio-design that mimics a real-life biological wetlab protocol and we discuss the properties of SynFlo and bio-design in general that encourage computational thinking.",10.1145/2839509.2850569,Association for Computing Machinery,163.0,ACM,,Research Article,France,PLOS ONE
Remixing as a Pathway to Computational Thinking,"Dasgupta, Sayamindu and Hale, William and Monroy-Hern\'{a}ndez, Andr\'{e}s and Hill, Benjamin Mako",2016,"Theorists and advocates of “remixing” have suggested that appropriation can act as a pathway for learning. We test this theory quantitatively using data from more than 2.4 million multimedia programming projects shared by more than 1 million users in the Scratch online community. First, we show that users who remix more often have larger repertoires of programming commands even after controlling for the numbers of projects and amount of code shared. Second, we show that exposure to computational thinking concepts through remixing is associated with increased likelihood of using those concepts. Our results support theories that young people learn through remixing, and have important implications for designers of social computing systems.",10.1145/2818048.2819984,Association for Computing Machinery,207.0,ACM,,Research Article,USA,Journal of Machine Learning Research
Approaches of Learning and Computational Thinking in Students that get into the Computer Sciences Career,"Villalba-Condori, Klinge Orlando and Cuba-Sayco, Sonia Esther Castro and Ch\'{a}vez, Evelyn Paola Guillen and Deco, Claudia and Bender, Cristina",2018,"The way in which the student processes the information, codifies it and recovers it, constitutes its learning approach. The learning process differentiates two qualitative ways of dealing with this process: the deep approach and the superficial approach. The use of each approach depends on the context. However, the adoption of a deep learning approach is positively related to the academic performance. Computational Thinking is defined as a competence of the XXI century, which allows solving problems from a computational point of view, and there is a variety of instruments that allow to measure it, and to know the state in which the evaluated student is. In this paper, we verified the existence of the positive significant relationship between the learning approach and computational thinking in students entering the career of Computer Sciences. By applying Pearson correlation test to verify the relationship between Learning Approaches and Computational Thinking, we found that both variables have homogeneous behaviors and that students show similar conditions. Men are in better conditions than women on the evaluated aspects of the Computational Thinking, Also, we found a significantly positive relationship between Computational Thinking and the Learning Approach (r = 0,882). This result shows that the learning approaches that students' practice are linked to the computational thinking they demonstrate. According to the results, the teachers of this career must develop active and deep methodological strategies due to the predisposition in these students.",10.1145/3284179.3284185,Association for Computing Machinery,245.0,ACM,,Review Paper,Argentina,PLOS ONE
Conceptions and Misconceptions about Computational Thinking among Italian Primary School Teachers,"Corradini, Isabella and Lodi, Michael and Nardelli, Enrico",2017,"Many advanced countries are recognizing more and more the importance of teaching computing, in some cases even as early as in primary school. ""Computational thinking"" is the term often used to denote the conceptual core of computer science or ""the way a computer scientist thinks"", as Wing put it. Such term - given also the lack of a widely accepted definition - has become a ""buzzword"" meaning different things to different people. We investigated the Italian primary school teachers' conceptions about computational thinking by analyzing the results of a survey (N=972) conducted in the context of ""Programma il Futuro"" project. Teachers have been asked to provide a definition of computational thinking and to answer three additional related closed-ended questions. The analysis shows that, while almost half of teachers (43.4\%) have included in their definitions some fundamental elements of computational thinking, very few (10.8\%) have been able to provide an acceptably complete definition. On a more positive note, the majority is aware that computational thinking is not characterized by coding or by the use of information technology.",10.1145/3105726.3106194,Association for Computing Machinery,112.0,ACM,,Review Paper,Japan,Journal of Machine Learning Research

The Role of Computational Thinking Practices in Making: How Beginning Youth Makers Encounter \&amp; Appropriate CT Practices in Making,"Wagh, Aditi and Gravel, Brian and Tucker-Raymond, Eli",2017,"1There are increasing calls to introduce computational thinking (CT) practices at the K-12 level. These calls are motivated by a consensus that CT practices can be valuable for everyone. This work is based on the assertion that making, or the personal construction of objects employing digital and/or analog technologies, can provide a rich context for enacting CT practices. This paper investigates the activities of a group of beginning youth makers creating an interactive digital/ physical water piano to ask: What forms of CT practices do they enact, and in what ways are these practices further developed in their work? Data includes qualitative ethnographic data including observations, recordings and interviews. We explore the ways youth encounter new, yet relatable and intriguing practices---like debugging to isolate an issue---and appropriate them within particular contexts and for particular goals, often to deal with the immediate challenges they are facing. We end by offering conjectures for ways to support beginning youth makers in appropriating CT practices.",10.1145/3141798.3141808,Association for Computing Machinery,29.0,ACM,,Editorial,Germany,ACM Transactions on Graphics

Most previous conclusions on the perception of virtual characters and the effect of character assignment in interactive applications have been reached through short, one-task experiments. To investigate more long-term effects of assigning versus customizing characters as well as explore perceptions of personal character appearance, we conduct a study in which sixth and seventh grade students are introduced to programming concepts with the software VEnvI (Virtual Environment Interactions) in seven one-hour sessions over two weeks. In VEnvI, students create performances for virtual characters by assembling blocks. With a between-subjects design, in which some of the students can alter their character and others are not given that possibility, we examine the influence of the presence or absence of character choice options on learning.We hypothesize that students have higher learning outcomes when they can choose and customize how their character looks compared to when they are assigned a character. We confirm this hypothesis for a category of learning (Remember and Understand) and give insights on students' relationships with their character.",10.1145/3119881.3119884,Association for Computing Machinery,151.0,ACM,,Conference Proceedings,Argentina,Science Advances
Exploring concurrency on computational thinking tools,"Slaviero, Cleyton and Haeusler, Edward Hermann",2015,"Computational thinking (CT) tools express their designers' perspective on how a selected set of Computer Science concepts should be introduced, typically hiding details to avoid unnecessary complexity. This paper focuses on how concurrency is dealt with by five well-known tools in this domain: Scratch, Alice, AgentSheets, NetLogo and Greenfoot. We present the results of a systematic analysis contrasting their model of concurrent behavior with the corresponding programming interface messages that trigger their users' interpretation and learning of concurrency-related concepts. We present and discuss the conceptualizations that potentially emerge from using these five tools and compare them with established concurrency concepts. Our findings indicate opportunities for an explicit exploration of how some concurrency aspects are implemented in games and simulations built with CT tools. We believe that this might facilitate future learning and comprehension of complex concurrency concepts, considering that the knowledge embedded in these tools can also influence students' understanding of concurrency.",10.1145/3148456.3148484,Association for Computing Machinery,95.0,ACM,,Case Study,Italy,Journal of Machine Learning Research

Assessing In-service Teachers' Development of Computational Thinking Practices in Teacher Development Courses,"Kong, Siu-Cheung and Lao, Andrew Chan-Chio",2019,"To promote computational thinking (CT) education in primary schools, in-service teachers need to attend CT teacher development programmes. One of the intended learning outcomes of the programme is to improve CT practices of teachers, which is one of the three key elements in the CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick. Assessing one's CT practices is challenging because there is no universally agreed-upon assessment method on CT practices in the existing literature. This study adopted the Evidence-centered Assessment Design (ECD) method to design test questions to evaluate teachers' development of CT practices. This study provided two Teacher Development Courses (TDCs) to enable teachers to teach CT through programming. TDC 1 focused on developing CT concepts, practices and perspectives of teachers, while TDC 2 put emphasis on pedagogies of teaching CT. 80 teachers participated in the two courses. The CT practices tests were administered before the courses, between the two courses and after the courses respectively. Results indicated that CT practices were improved progressively when the in-service teachers attended the two courses. It indicated that it is useful for teachers to experience programming practices in their initial learning as well as during their pedagogical development.",10.1145/3287324.3287470,Association for Computing Machinery,207.0,ACM,,Technical Report,China,Nature Communications

From Algorithmic to Computational Thinking: On the Way for Computing for all Students,"Sys\l{}o, Maciej M.",2015,"Computational thinking, as coined by Jeannette Wing, is a fundamental skill for all to be able to live in today's world, a mode of thought that goes well beyond computing and provides a framework for reasoning about problems and methods of their solution. It has a long tradition as algorithmic thinking which within computer science is a competence to formulate a solution of a problem in the form of an algorithm and then to implement the algorithm as a computer program. Computational thinking is not an adequate characterization of computer science as claimed by Peter Denning and he is right -- it is a collection of key mental tools and practices originated in computing but addressed to all areas far beyond computer science. As an extension of algorithmic thinking, it includes thinking with many levels of abstraction as a problem solving approach inherently connected to computer science and addressed to all students to use computers and computing skills in solving problems in various school subjects coming from various scientific and applied areas. Computational thinking involves concepts, skills and competences that lie at the heart of computing, such as abstraction, decomposition, generalization, approximation, heuristics, algorithm design, efficiency and complexity issues and therefore it is clear that basic computer science knowledge helps to systematically, correctly, and efficiently process information, perform tasks, and solve problems. Although coming from computer science, computational thinking is not only the study of computer science, though computers play an essential role in the design of problems' solutions. It is a very important and useful mode of thinking in almost all disciplines and school subjects as an insight into what can and cannot be computed.In this talk we shall discuss a new computing curriculum addressed to ALL students in K-12 in Poland which motivates them to use computational thinking in solving problems in various school subjects. Moreover its goal is to encourage and prepare students from early school years to consider computing and related fields as disciplines of their future study and professional career. To this end, the curriculum allows teachers and schools to personalize learning and teaching according to students' interests, abilities, and needs.The new computing curriculum benefits a lot from our experience in teaching informatics in our schools for almost 30 years -- the first curriculum was approved by the ministry of education in 1985, 20 years after the first regular classes on informatics were held in two high schools in Wroc\l{}aw and in Warsaw. Today, informatics is an obligatory subject in middle school (grades 7-9) and high school (grades 10-12) and it will replace computer lessons (mainly on ICT) in elementary schools (grades 1-6). The new curriculum is also addressed to vocational education.",10.1145/2729094.2742582,Association for Computing Machinery,118.0,ACM,,Review Paper,China,ACM Transactions on Graphics

To find an answer to this question, 71 pre-service teacher students completed a survey with 20 Bebras tasks as a measure of computational thinking and a non-verbal intelligence test (TONI-3) to assess their general problem-solving ability. The large and significant correlation of r(70) = .53, p &lt; .001, indicates that both concepts are highly related.

Sphero.Math: a computational thinking-enhanced fourth grade mathematics curriculum,"Weintrop, David and Walkoe, Janet and Walton, Margaret and Bih, Janet and Moon, Peter and Elby, Andrew and Bennett, Bianca and Kantzer, Madison",2022,"Computational thinking (CT) constitutes an essential set of skills and practices that all students should learn in order to effectively and meaningfully participate in an increasingly computational world. This paper introduces Sphero.Math, a curriculum that integrates CT concepts and practices into 4th-grade mathematics classrooms using the Sphero robot. Sphero.Math was co-designed with school district partners in such a way as to achieve two central design goals. First, integrate CT and mathematics in a mutually-supportive way, meaning that learners engage with CT as a means to deepen mathematics learning and that mathematics serves as a context to learn CT. Second, create a CT-infused curriculum using existing school/district resources that is designed to fit within the constraints of public school classrooms. Along with introducing Sphero.Math and its design goals, this paper presents empirical evidence for the types of CT and math learning opportunities that Sphero.Math can provide for students. In doing so, this work contributes to our understanding of ways to productively integrate CT into elementary classrooms and advances our understanding of how to work within existing educational infrastructure to provide effective and equitable CT learning opportunities for all students.",,Association for Computing Machinery,224.0,ACM,,Technical Report,Canada,Journal of Computer Science
"A Tangible, Story-Construction Process Employing Spatial, Computational-Thinking","Soleimani, Arash and Green, Keith Evan and Herro, Danielle and Walker, Ian D.",2016,"The outcome of a multidisciplinary and iterative process, CyberPLAYce is a tangible, interactive, cyber-physical learning tool for children supporting computational thinking and, particularly, playful storytelling. CyberPLAYce finds inspiration in the concept of child-computer interaction, where meaning is constructed through spatially reconfiguring the physical environment. The novel aspect of CyberPLAYce is its extension of cyber-learning to the dimension of space where children construct meaning at a larger physical scale. This paper outlines the motivations for CyberPLAYce, focuses on the full arc of design and evaluation activities concerning computational thinking (CT) practices that engaged 8-12-year-old storytellers, and concludes with a consideration of future work focusing on spatial thinking with CyberPLAYce. Results from our empirical study suggest that cyber-physical play afforded by CyberPLAYce scaffolds computational thinking, creating, and sharing in children. Particularly for IDC researchers in the educational domain, CyberPLAYce represents a Research-through-design exemplar supporting children's enjoyment of learning and meaning-construction.",10.1145/2930674.2930703,Association for Computing Machinery,97.0,ACM,,Conference Proceedings,Japan,ACM Transactions on Graphics
Implementation of Unplugged Teaching Activities to Foster Computational Thinking Skills in Primary School from a Gender Perspective,"Torres-Torres, Yucnary-Daitiana and Rom\'{a}n-Gonz\'{a}lez, Marcos and P\'{e}rez-Gonz\'{a}lez, Juan-Carlos",2019,"The participation of girls and women is fundamental in solving problems that the society demands. Currently, the figures indicate a deficit of female presence in the STEM context, which implies the loss of the talent of the female collective. The school, as the transforming axis of society, must generate actions that motivate, involve and generate commitment in girls and women, enhancing their engagement in the STEM context. This paper shows two unplugged activities taken from a serial of activities implemented with elementary students and families in a digital cultural center in Madrid-Spain. The implementation is based on general objectives such as 1. To introduce and motivate interest since an early age in computer programming, 2. To develop gender dynamics that educate on gender equity to strengthen female empowerment in the STEM area. Performing the example in the roles of female gender in science, as well as transforming stereotypes with the purpose of motivate girls and adult women, without excluding the male group. The activities also seek to train Computational Thinking skills, to introduce basic computer programming concepts as well as showing that unplugged activities are important in teaching computer programming, and integrate women into the STEM area, as an important tool to reduce gender gaps. Based on our informal observations, some results were: involvement of the female collective in the construction of codes, improvement in the dynamics of gender equity in each activity and that the girls created more complex codes than males.",10.1145/3362789.3362813,Association for Computing Machinery,239.0,ACM,,Short Communication,UK,PLOS ONE

Early validation of computational thinking pattern analysis,"Koh, Kyu Han and Nickerson, Hilarie and Basawapatna, Ashok and Repenning, Alexander",2014,"End-user game design affords teachers a unique opportunity to integrate computational thinking concepts into their classrooms. However, it is not always apparent in game and simulation projects what computational thinking-related skills students have acquired. Computational Thinking Pattern Analysis (CTPA) enables teachers to visualize which of nine specific skills students have mastered in game design that can then be used to create simulations. CTPA has the potential to automatically recognize and calculate student computational thinking skills, as well as to map students' computational thinking skill progression, as they proceed through the curriculum. The current research furthers knowledge of CTPA by exploring its validity based on how its performance correlates to human grading of student games.

The goals of the project are to (1) build a knowledge base on how CT can be promoted in early childhood through integration with mathematics and science, (2) develop learning blueprints to guide the development of integrated classroom and family resources, and (3) develop and evaluate prototype activities to identify design principles useful to future development efforts integrating CT and STEM in early childhood. In this work, a multidisciplinary research team with expertise in CT, early science and mathematics, technology and media, and home and school learning partners with preschool educators and parents to co-design and pilot test prototype activities. Emerging prototypes presented integrate fundamental science and mathematics concepts and practices with CT skills such as problem decomposition, logical and algorithmic thinking, abstraction and debugging. They include hands-on activities with manipulatives familiar to young children and developmentally appropriate technology with unique affordances for complementing and reinforcing the learning that occurs during hands-on experiences.

Preparing upper elementary school teachers for integrating computational thinking into regular classroom activities,"Ouyang, Youwen and Hayden, Katherine L. and Remold, Julie",2018,"Recent initiatives demonstrate the interest in, and demand for, computational thinking education in elementary schools. However, teachers' readiness for programming-based activities along with their concerns about taking away time from key subject content present barriers for broader integration of computational thinking. This paper presents our experience and findings of a yearlong professional development for a cohort of 21 teachers from self-contained classrooms in grades 4 - 6. The project targeted these grade levels for two reasons: (1) self-contained classrooms provide maximum contact time between teachers and students, affording more flexibility in scheduling and potential for sustained impact, and (2) these grades are critical times for students to build interest and foundations in STEM while many teachers in these classrooms have limited STEM and computing background. The paper provides an overview of the professional development and describes selected activities in more detail. The impact of the professional development on the participating teachers is also presented.",,Consortium for Computing Sciences in Colleges,178.0,ACM,,Editorial,Germany,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering

Promoting computational thinking with programming,"Selby, Cynthia C.",2012,"The term computational thinking has received some discussion in the field of computer science education research. The term is defined as the concept of thinking about problems in a way that can be implemented in a computing device. Of course, after having thought about a problem using computational thinking skills, the next step should be to use programming skills to implement the solution. This work in progress is exploring ways in which programming can be employed as a tool to teach computational thinking and problem solving. Data is collected from teachers, academics, and professionals from various industries. They are purposively selected because of their knowledge of or interest in the topics of problem solving, computational thinking, and the teaching of programming. This data is analyzed within the paradigm of the grounded theory approach. The results of an initial analysis imply an ordering of complexity associated with computational thinking skills, imply connections between computational thinking skills and programming activities, and imply a relationship between computational thinking skills and other taxonomies of learning.",10.1145/2481449.2481466,Association for Computing Machinery,117.0,ACM,,Research Article,Argentina,ACM Transactions on Graphics
Are Children More Motivated with Plugged or Unplugged Approach to Computational Thinking? (Abstract Only),"Jiang, Shan and Wong, Gary K.W.",2018,"In recent years, we have seen an increasing interest in bringing programming back to K-12 education. Many educators begin to recognize the necessity of helping children develop computational thinking (CT) as an essential skill to address 21st century challenges. In this poster, we report the preliminary findings from the first year of a 3-year longitudinal study based on a coding curriculum for Grade 4 to Grade 6. This 3-year study aims to gain an understanding of how coding activities helps children at upper primary school ages develop CT for problem solving, and if this problem-solving mindset is transferrable to other contexts, for example, daily life scenario and mathematical field. A part of the research focuses on a comparative study between students' intrinsic motivation of coding (i.e. ""plugged"") activities and ""unplugged"" activities (i.e. learning concepts from computer science through paper-based games without programming), which helps us understand the advantages and disadvantages of different learning approaches to CT. At the end of the first year, around 600 fourth graders"" were assessed with their CT competence and affective tendency through: (1) a pre/post-test on the CT skill and mathematical ability; (2) a questionnaire on intrinsic motivation in plugged and unplugged activities. The preliminary findings indicate that students have gained a good programming-related knowledge and improved problem-solving skills through our curriculum. They were intrinsically motivated to participated in both types of activities.

Grounding Computational Thinking Skill Acquisition Through Contextualized Instruction,"Nickerson, Hilarie and Brand, Catharine and Repenning, Alexander",2015,"Computational thinking (CT) involves a broadly applicable and complex set of processes that are often explained by way of the knowledge, attitudes, and general practices that they entail. However, to become facile with CT, learners require instruction that is grounded in concrete, relevant experiences. This paper examines teacher practices that are intended to promote CT skill acquisition through instruction that takes place in two framing contexts. The phenomenological context, which is based on observable patterns of object interaction that recur in games and simulations, is particularly valuable for developing the capacity to think abstractly. Abstraction is the key to recognizing analogous conditions, an ability that is the basis for transferring learning to new situations. The disciplinary context describes areas of application within and across subject areas, including computer science, that can foster proficiency with data representation, problem decomposition, and other CT skills. Using the Scalable Game Design curriculum as a lens to examine classroom practices, we find that teachers both plan and enact CT instruction in these contexts.",10.1145/2787622.2787720,Association for Computing Machinery,57.0,ACM,,Technical Report,Argentina,Science Advances

Evaluation and Impact of a Required Computational Thinking Course for Architecture Students,"Senske, Nick",2017,"Non-major education continues to be a growing area of study in computer science education research. This paper focuses on architects as an audience and the teaching of computer science by architects, who successfully applied computer science education research. The author describes the structure and development of a required computational thinking course with an average yearly enrollment of 69 students and how it applied best practices from Media Computation to improve student outcomes and engagement. A four-year impact study found that a flipped classroom model combined with peer learning methods was superior to traditional lectures and labs for improving student performance and reducing attrition. Comparisons of pre- and post-class surveys revealed an improved perception of computing and an increased interest in the subject -- a positive outcome for a required introductory course. The author also studied the course's long-term effects. Three years after taking the course, a majority of students felt they retained what they learned and that learning computational thinking helped them to learn new software and perform better in advanced computing courses. By taking into account how architects learn and revising in response to assessments, we believe our course structure and teaching methodology demonstrates an effective case for applying computer science education research within an architectural curriculum.",10.1145/3017680.3017750,Association for Computing Machinery,51.0,ACM,,Research Article,Germany,Journal of Computer Science

A Study on the Assessment of Introductory Computational Thinking via Scratch Programming in Primary Schools,"Fagerlund, Janne",2018,"Computational thinking (CT), a transversal intellectual foundation integral to computer science, is making its way into compulsory comprehensive education worldwide. Students are expected to attain skills and knowledge in such interdisciplinary CT principles as Algorithmic thinking, Data representation, and Debugging. Problem-solving by designing and manipulating interactive media with Scratch, a graphical programming tool, is popular especially at the primary school level. However, there has been confusion regarding how introductory CT can be operationalized for educational practice. Teachers and students need research-based knowledge for setting appropriate learning goals in addition to instruments for formative assessment that potentially improve the quality of learning. This study contributes to these issues by developing the assessment for learning of CT via Scratch in primary school settings. A review on prior studies involving the assessment of CT-related computational ideas in Scratch has led to the conceptualization of a revised assessment framework. Next steps in the study are analyzing fourth grade students' (N=58) Scratch projects and exploring complementary methods for analyzing CT in video recordings of the students' programming processes.",10.1145/3230977.3231013,Association for Computing Machinery,235.0,ACM,,Editorial,Australia,Journal of Machine Learning Research

Training Teachers to Integrate Computational Thinking into K-12 Teaching,"Hodhod, Rania and Khan, Shamim and Kurt-Peker, Yesem and Ray, Lydia",2016,"Computational thinking (CT), which encompasses strategies for problem analysis and solution design, is highly applicable in all STEM disciplines, including computer science, for learning concepts as well as solving problems. Yet, the exposure of K-12 students to CT in many schools is practically non-existent. For students to acquire this important skill, teachers require in-depth knowledge of the problem solving strategies that define CT, and strategies for integrating CT into their lesson plans. The proposed special session will be both a tutorial on CT and an interactive session for sharing the experience and results from a CT workshop held at Columbus State University for middle and high school STEM subject teachers. This workshop, offered as a part of the ACT4STEM (Applying Computational Thinking for STEM Disciplines) project, took place in the summer of 2015. It brought together teachers from the metropolitan Columbus area in Georgia with priority given to teachers from high-need schools (as determined by the GA Department of Education [1]). The workshop introduced the participants to CT concepts and demonstrated how CT strategies of pattern recognition, generalization, problem decomposition and algorithmic thinking can be used to improve student learning of STEM concepts. The proposed special session will present sample CT modules developed for the ACT4STEM workshop in the form of a tutorial and projects and lesson plans designed by participants during the workshop. It will include interactive, hands-on activities and discussions in addition to results from the teachers' actual experiences on applying these lesson plans in their classes. This special session will benefit K12 teachers of STEM subjects interested in improving their students' comprehension of discipline related concepts and their application. Moreover, computer science faculty interested in helping K-12 teachers by organizing training sessions will gain valuable insights from the first-hand accounts of the presenters of their own experience with such an effort.",10.1145/2839509.2844675,Association for Computing Machinery,186.0,ACM,,Short Communication,Canada,ACM Transactions on Graphics

Interdisciplinary computing collaborations have become a popular mode of instruction in upper-level CS courses. In many cases, these collaborations have been with other STEM disciplines. However, there are non-STEM fields that have been transformed by computer science and can also serve as fruitful test beds for curricular innovation; journalism is one such field. In this study, undergraduate students in CS and journalism courses focused on creating a computational solution to address a real community need. The study investigates whether immersion in multidisciplinary collaborative experiences increases the computational thinking abilities of both CS and non-CS students. 41 CS students participated in the study alongside 96 students in a range of other STEM and non-STEM majors. Quantitative data were collected to gauge students' attainment of concepts and skills constitutive to computational thinking. Pre-test data indicate that CS students were no different from other STEM students in their own assessment of computational thinking and skills. Post-test data indicate that while all students made significant gains in self-assessment of skills and knowledge, CS majors fared significantly better than their peers.

Introducing teachers to computational thinking using unplugged storytelling,"Curzon, Paul and McOwan, Peter W. and Plant, Nicola and Meagher, Laura R.",2014,"Many countries are introducing new school computing syllabuses that make programming and computational thinking core components. However, many of the teachers involved have major knowledge, skill and pedagogy gaps. We have explored the effectiveness of using 'unplugged' methods (constructivist, often kinaesthetic, activities away from computers) with contextually rich storytelling to introduce teachers to these topics in a non-threatening way. We describe the approach we have used in workshops for teachers and its survey based evaluation. Teachers were highly positive that the approach was inspiring, confidence building and gave them a greater understanding of the concepts involved, as well as giving practical teaching techniques that they would use.",10.1145/2670757.2670767,Association for Computing Machinery,148.0,ACM,,Case Study,Canada,Journal of Computer Science
Design and Preliminary Results From a Computational Thinking Course,"Kafura, Dennis and Bart, Austin Cory and Chowdhury, Bushra",2015,"This paper describes the design and initial assessment of a general education course in computational thinking for non-computer science majors. The key elements of the course include multidisciplinary cohorts to achieve learning across contexts, multiple languages/tools, including block-based and textual programming languages, repeated exposure to the underlying computational ideas in different forms, and student-defined projects using real world (""big"") data to heighten motivation through self-directed contextualized learning. The preliminary multi-methods assessment shows that the course engendered high levels of motivation, achieved key objectives for learning in and across contexts, largely affirmed the choice of languages/tools, and supported, though less strongly than anticipated, the motivational effects of real-world data",10.1145/2729094.2742593,Association for Computing Machinery,18.0,ACM,,Case Study,Japan,Nature Communications

Bringing computational thinking to the digital humanities: introducing students to explorations of digitized texts,"LeBlanc, Mark D.",2017,"The rapid digitization of texts presents both new opportunities and real barriers of entry to computer-assisted explorations of texts for both faculty and students. Computer science programs, especially those on liberal arts campuses, are well positioned to help faculty and students across the humanities (and social sciences) who seek to apply computational techniques to their digitized corpora of interest. This workshop provides hands-on practice with Lexos [1], a web-based workflow for entry-level text processing, statistical analysis, and visualization of results when exploring digitized texts. Funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), Lexos reflects six years of software development with undergraduates in a model that blends a start-up company with interdisciplinary research. In addition to hands-on play, participants will be introduced to course materials used in our ""Computing for Poets"" course as well as share in discussions of effective practices for outreach to the digital humanities on their campuses. More information on our successful use in the classroom and in our own research is available at our website [2].

Computational thinking,"Wing, Jeannette",2009,"My vision for the 21st Century: Computational thinking will be a fundamental skill used by everyone in the world. Just as reading, writing, and arithmetic are fundamental skills every child learns, computational thinking is a skill needed for every citizen to function in today's global society. Computational thinking is an approach to solving problems, building systems, and understanding human behavior that draws on the power and limits of computing. Computational thinking is the use of abstraction to tackle complexity and the use of automation to tackle scale. The combination of the automation of abstraction underlies the enormous capability and reach of computing. In this talk I will argue that computational thinking has already begun to influence many disciplines, from the sciences to the humanities, but that the best is yet to come. Looking to the future, we can anticipate even more profound impact of computational thinking on science, technology, and society: on the ways new discoveries will be made, innovation will occur, and cultures will evolve.Teaching computational thinking also raises new challenges for education, especially in early grades. While we have models for teaching children mathematics and physics, we do not yet have such models for teaching computational thinking. Moreover, we have the unique opportunity to make most effective use of the computer as a tool to enhance the learning of computational thinking.In this talk, I will give examples of computational thinking, including ones from our daily lives. It is exciting to imagine the day when computational thinking will be commonplace.",,Consortium for Computing Sciences in Colleges,169.0,ACM,,Technical Report,Mexico,Journal of Machine Learning Research

Recognizing computational thinking patterns,"Basawapatna, Ashok and Koh, Kyu Han and Repenning, Alexander and Webb, David C. and Marshall, Krista Sekeres",2011,"End-user game design tools are effective in motivating and exposing students with no prior programming experience to computer science. However, while there is good evidence that these environments are effective motivators, the question remains what do students actually learn? For our purposes, using AgentSheets, we would like to know if students can apply the knowledge obtained from programming games to creating science simulations. Specifically, we want to better understand if students are able to recognize Computational Thinking Patterns (CTP) from their game programming experience. Computational Thinking Patterns are abstract programming patterns that enable agent interactions not only in games but also in science simulations. Students and teachers who participated in a game design summer institute were administered a Computational Thinking Pattern Quiz (CTP Quiz). This quiz tested the participants' ability to recognize and understand patterns in a context removed from game programming.

Towards a dialectic relationship between the implicit and explicit nature of computational thinking: a computer semiotics perspective,"Spangsberg, Thomas Hvid and Brynskov, Martin",2017,"Computational Thinking (CT) has gained in popularity in recent years, both within educational and political discourses. It is more than ever important to discuss the term itself in order to determine to which extent it is helpful in solving the challenges it has been suggested to address. Recently, Denning (2017) proposed that CT can be viewed as either ""traditional"" or ""new"". Traditional CT is a skillset resulting from engaging in traditional computing activities, e.g. programming, whereas new CT forefronts certain skills as desired in problem solving. By looking at CT through the perspective of computer semiotics, specifically the algorithmic sign, it is possible to dissolve the hard distinction of traditional vs. new. Instead, a perception of CT having both an implicit and an explicit nature emerges, allowing for a dialectic relationship between CT's integrated implicit and explicit nature.",10.1145/3141880.3144591,Association for Computing Machinery,237.0,ACM,,Editorial,Spain,Nature Communications
Situating Computational Thinking with Big Data: Pedagogy and Technology (Abstract Only),"Bart, Austin Cory",2015,"As Computational Thinking becomes pervasive in undergraduate programs, new students must be educated in meaningful, authentic contexts that they find both motivating and relatable. I propose working with big data as a novel context for introductory programming, authentic given its importance in diverse fields such as agriculture, history, and more.

Computational thinking outreach: reaching across the K-12 curriculum,"Pokorny, Kian L. and White, Nathan",2012,"Recruiting a precollege audience into computing disciplines can be challenging. One approach is to engage those that have a strong influence with the precollege students, K-12 teachers [16]. To engage these teachers, we held a Google-sponsored Computer Science for High School (CS4HS) workshop at our small university. The workshop, scheduled over a two day period, included presentations on the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) K-12 computer science curriculum standards, recruiting woman into computing disciplines, and careers in technology. Additionally, there were hands-on sessions with Scratch programming, FIRST robotics, computer hardware, programming in Excel, and CS Unplugged. A unique aspect of this workshop was that high school, middle school, and elementary school teachers, both in and out of technology-related disciplines, were invited to attend. Another unique aspect of our workshop was the inclusion of several sessions with activities for participants to create action plans for incorporating computational thinking components into the curriculum at their respective schools. This included a presentation from a former school superintendent on how to work with school districts in considering computer science as a component in the curriculum and several small-group working sessions to develop the action plans.

Mind the Gap: The Illusion of Skill Acquisition in Computational Thinking,"Bao, Yeting and Hosseini, Hadi",2023,"With the advent of online educational platforms and the advances in pedagogical technologies, self-directed learning has emerged as one of the most popular modes of learning. Distance education---elevated by the COVID-19 pandemic---involves methods of instruction through a variety of remote activities which often rely on educational videos for mastery. In the absence of direct student engagement, the asynchronous nature of remote activities may deteriorate the quality of education for learners. Students often have an illusion of skill acquisition after watching videos, which results in overestimation of abilities and skills. We focus on the efficacy of skill acquisition through interactive technologies and assess their impact on computational thinking in comparison with delivery through other traditional media (e.g. videos and texts).

Social computational thinking tools: reinventing computation education in public schools,"Repenning, Alexander",2011,"For the last 15 years we have been exploring notions of design and social media as means to foster highly engaging as well as effective educational environments. We have created what we call social computational thinking tools with the goal to synthesize human abilities with computer affordances. This presentation will outline three social computational thinking tools and discuss how they have combined notions of design and social media to create unique learning experiences in the classroom:1) Mr. Vetro is a Collective Simulation teaching students about human physiology through technologically enhanced role play of interacting organs,2) Scalable Game Design teaches students computational thinking through game design. They learn about computational thinking patterns in the context of game design and later apply these patterns to scientific simulation building.3) CyberCollage is a Collective Programming environment enabling students to work on game and simulation projects collaboratively in real time.",,Brazilian Computer Society,151.0,ACM,,Short Communication,Chile,Science Advances

From computational thinking to computational values,"Abelson, Hal",2012,"SIGCSE members love the beauty of computational thinking. They know the joy of bringing those ideas to young people. That love for computational thinking entails respect for the computational values that empower people in the digital world. For academics, those values have been central to the flowering of computing as an intellectual endeavor. Today, those values are increasingly threatened by stresses from both within and outside academia: squabbles over who owns academic work, increasingly stringent and overreaching intellectual property laws, and the replacement of open computing platforms by closed applications and walled-garden application markets.In this talk I'll describe some things we've done at MIT to support computational values, like open publication of all our course materials, our faculty policy on open publication of academic research, and our recently announced initiative for open online instruction based on non-proprietary software platforms. I'll discuss Creative Commons licensing and Free Software, and the importance of tinkerability for empowering citizens in an information society. And I'll describe App Inventor for Android, a new programming tool motivated by the vision that all of us us can experience mobile computing as creators using tools that we can control and reshape, rather than only as consumers of packaged applications.",10.1145/2157136.2157206,Association for Computing Machinery,192.0,ACM,,Case Study,Canada,ACM Transactions on Graphics

Introducing computational thinking in education courses,"Yadav, Aman and Zhou, Ninger and Mayfield, Chris and Hambrusch, Susanne and Korb, John T.",2011,"As computational thinking becomes a fundamental skill for the 21st century, K-12 teachers should be exposed to computing principles. This paper describes the implementation and evaluation of a computational thinking module in a required course for elementary and secondary education majors. We summarize the results from open-ended and multiple-choice questionnaires given both before and after the module to assess the students' attitudes toward and understanding of computational thinking. The results suggest that given relevant information about computational thinking, education students' attitudes toward computer science becomes more favorable and they will be more likely to integrate computing principles in their future teaching.",10.1145/1953163.1953297,Association for Computing Machinery,66.0,ACM,,Research Article,Canada,Nature Communications
"Reported Development of Computational Thinking, Through Computer Science and Programming, and its Benefits for Primary School Students: (Abstract Only)","Duncan, Caitlin",2018,"Across the world there has been a paradigm shift in school education, as many countries are incorporating Computer Science (CS), programming, and Computational Thinking (CT), into their K-12 curriculums for the first time. In 2018 these subjects will be introduced to the New Zealand (NZ) Digital Technologies curriculum under the subject of ""Computational Thinking"". Like the majority of countries who have introduced these topics, NZ faces challenges in preparing teachers, and in successfully implementing a curriculum which achieves its educational goals. To support this curriculum, we have been conducting studies in primary schools across NZ, trialing resources with teachers and students. Building on a 2014 exploratory study on CS and programming in intermediate school, this project investigates the existing assumptions around CT education in K-12. It aims to address the specific questions: How do we teach CT concepts and approaches to primary aged students? If they learn CT, does it have the expected positive impacts on students learning? And, what other positive and negative impacts does this have?Throughout 2015 and 2016 a study was conducted with 18 primary school teachers from across NZ, who used CS Unplugged and educational programming languages in their classrooms. Teachers submitted feedback on these classes through an online form, and participated in semi-structured interviews. The feedback responses and interview transcripts were analysed using a thematic approach, which revealed many positive impacts on students general learning, minimal negative impacts, and observations of CT development.",10.1145/3159450.3162325,Association for Computing Machinery,226.0,ACM,,Technical Report,Australia,Computers & Education
Computational thinking in a game design course,"Settle, Amber",2011,"As a part of an NSF-funded project to enhance computational thinking in undergraduate general education courses, activities and assessments were developed for a game design course taught at DePaul University. The focus of the course is on game analysis and design, but the course textbook uses an approach that is heavily grounded in computational thinking principles. We describe the course activities and assignments and discuss an initial assessment of those materials. Our results show that there is a gap in difficulty between several of the activities and indicate that the materials developed help students to better learn the computational thinking concepts in the course.",10.1145/2047594.2047612,Association for Computing Machinery,215.0,ACM,,Editorial,Canada,Journal of Computer Science
Computational thinking for youth in practice,"Lee, Irene and Martin, Fred and Denner, Jill and Coulter, Bob and Allan, Walter and Erickson, Jeri and Malyn-Smith, Joyce and Werner, Linda",2011,"Computational thinking (CT) has been described as the use of abstraction, automation, and analysis in problem-solving [3]. We examine how these ways of thinking take shape for middle and high school youth in a set of NSF-supported programs. We discuss opportunities and challenges in both in-school and after-school contexts. Based on these observations, we present a ""use-modify-create"" framework, representing three phases of students' cognitive and practical activity in computational thinking. We recommend continued investment in the development of CT-rich learning environments, in educators who can facilitate their use, and in research on the broader value of computational thinking.",10.1145/1929887.1929902,Association for Computing Machinery,109.0,ACM,,Technical Report,Spain,ACM Transactions on Graphics

Thinking about computational thinking,"Lu, James J. and Fletcher, George H.L.",2009,"Jeannette Wing's call for teaching Computational Thinking (CT) as a formative skill on par with reading, writing, and arithmetic places computer science in the category of basic knowledge. Just as proficiency in basic language arts helps us to effectively communicate and in basic math helps us to successfully quantitate, proficiency in computational thinking helps us to systematically and efficiently process information and tasks. But while teaching everyone to think computationally is a noble goal, there are pedagogical challenges. Perhaps the most confounding issue is the role of programming, and whether we can separate it from teaching basic computer science. How much programming, if any, should be required for CT proficiency?We believe that to successfully broaden participation in computer science, efforts must be made to lay the foundations of CT long before students experience their first programming language. We posit that programming is to Computer Science what proof construction is to mathematics, and what literary analysis is to English. Hence by analogy, programming should be the entrance into higher CS, and not the student's first encounter in CS. We argue that in the absence of programming, teaching CT should focus on establishing vocabularies and symbols that can be used to annotate and describe computation and abstraction, suggest information and execution, and provide notation around which mental models of processes can be built. Lastly, we conjecture that students with sustained exposure to CT in their formative education will be better prepared for programming and the CS curriculum, and, furthermore, that they might choose to major in CS not only for career opportunities, but also for its intellectual content.",10.1145/1508865.1508959,Association for Computing Machinery,162.0,ACM,,Editorial,Brazil,Science Advances
